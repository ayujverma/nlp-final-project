00:00:55.079 in his third world cup he won the title
00:00:57.840 once yogilo has not done that and the
00:01:00.600 feeling in Germany is that he has to win
00:01:03.719 this world cup to justify his position
00:01:07.040 though he is contracted for another two
00:01:10.020 years
00:01:10.890 [Applause]
00:01:13.860 final press to be said for those in the

00:02:24.300 July the 8th of Germany last won the
00:02:27.000 World Cup was in Rome when they beat
00:02:29.280 Argentina by a goal to nil
00:02:32.040 [Applause]
00:02:36.500 most people I think are saying that this
00:02:38.940 is a 50 50 call how will Brazil respond
00:02:41.640 to the loss of Neymar
00:02:44.580 straight away the ball is played up
00:02:46.379 there but uh Only onto the head of the
00:02:48.660 tall full-back pivoters
00:02:51.540 Brazil with the first Attack featuring
00:02:53.340 Mike on who's won a starting place again
00:02:55.800 ahead of Danny Alves the
00:02:58.620 ball went out for the corner will be the
00:03:01.620 first of the match for Brazil won by
00:03:03.300 fernandinho
00:03:04.200 [Applause]
00:03:08.099 steam Schweinsteiger in his Third World
00:03:10.980 Cup finals just unable to keep the whole
00:03:13.440 of the ball Crossing that line Oscar is
00:03:16.379 charged with taking the corner kicks for
00:03:19.200 Brazil
00:03:22.920 David Luiz who's got two goals in these
00:03:25.440 finals is one of those in here for this
00:03:27.300 one
00:03:34.319 and eventually Oscar will be allowed to
00:03:37.019 take it doesn't decide to pull it short
00:03:39.360 put it into the mix
00:03:42.000 and then breaks for Marcelo one of the
00:03:44.580 curly-haired Brigade favored by so many
00:03:47.400 of the Brazilians
00:03:49.379 and that's a deep ball in there very
00:03:52.140 well dealt with initially by Hoover dis
00:03:56.400 Germany have not yet got into the
00:03:58.319 Brazilian half and they won't do there
00:04:00.299 because of the slip remorsal
00:04:02.879 which encourages Oscar
00:04:05.099 to move closer to the 18-yard zone of
00:04:07.620 the German defense
00:04:10.080 this will be just Captain by the
00:04:11.819 diminutive Bernard
00:04:19.918 expected a strong of a stirring start
00:04:22.139 from the south Americans and that's what
00:04:23.940 we're getting
00:04:24.330 [Applause]
00:04:27.120 both these teams unbeatening reaching
00:04:29.820 this stage of the finals
00:04:37.020 get given but Marcelo may get a shot
00:04:39.120 through here he does its wide first shot
00:04:41.759 of the game and it comes from the
00:04:43.080 Brazilian left ball back Marcelo
00:04:48.300 he does have goals in his locker he's
00:04:50.340 pulled this one right across the face of
00:04:52.259 goal however the defender from Real
00:04:53.940 Madrid that was the little nudge there
00:04:55.979 from Schweinsteiger on Louis Gustavo
00:04:58.380 that's 60 odd thousand people in this
00:05:00.780 Stadium thought Mary did a free kick and
00:05:03.180 what important man was that man in blue
00:05:04.800 the referee Marco Rodriguez
00:05:11.400 foreign
00:05:14.280 [Applause]
00:05:21.240 Louise who has grown in statues so much
00:05:23.820 so that he said he could be qualified as
00:05:26.580 a saint before long if he keeps going
00:05:28.080 like this and what a ball that is over
00:05:30.060 to The Far Side grabbed by Neuer just as
00:05:33.060 Bernard came in to try and tip it past
00:05:35.400 him
00:05:38.400 or from Hulk
00:05:43.199 but Germany are always resourceful and
00:05:45.300 so they will be here Dante comes to the
00:05:48.300 rescue after David Luiz got in the first
00:05:50.280 challenge
00:05:52.500 you can barely hear yourself thinking
00:05:54.539 the stadium that was a lovely ball from
00:05:56.220 Hulk and Neuer had to stretch all of his
00:05:58.620 six foot five inch frame
00:06:03.240 now Hummels who just like David Louise
00:06:05.580 has got two goals in these finals they
00:06:07.800 were center-back Schweinsteiger
00:06:11.000 person's ball rebounds off Micon
00:06:13.650 [Applause]
00:06:15.240 this is Benedict vividus

00:06:21.720 from shalco he's captain of his Club
00:06:23.699 side
00:06:27.900 incredible progress being made down the
00:06:30.000 touch line under the gauge of the
00:06:32.340 Brazilian coach who won the World Cup
00:06:35.100 with Brazil in 2002.
00:06:39.440 he also took Portugal to third place in
00:06:42.780 2006 in Germany
00:06:44.940 [Music]
00:06:48.720 to have a little back heel
00:06:51.060 nice play and then Cruz but the
00:06:53.280 interception here could prove costly
00:06:55.520 Brazilian able
00:06:57.419 to make any acceleration down that left
00:07:00.060 touch line Yogi love now at the age of
00:07:03.060 54 he was assistant to Jurgen Klinsmann
00:07:05.880 when the World Cup finals were staged in
00:07:07.620 Germany in 2006. and he was very
00:07:11.100 critical at his press conference
00:07:12.600 yesterday about some of the tackling
00:07:14.340 that's gone on in the quarterfinals of
00:07:16.979 the World Cup which he thought went
00:07:18.479 beyond the bones and he cited Brazil in
00:07:22.199 particular
00:07:23.180 but an incendiary thing to do
00:07:26.360 in my game with Colombia
00:07:30.060 the one of course in which Neymar was
00:07:32.039 injured
00:07:34.259 Scolari did ask Neymar to come to the
00:07:36.720 stadium today and a medical decision was
00:07:38.880 being taken as to
00:07:40.500 whether the great player could make the
00:07:42.780 journey or not
00:07:44.099 he's gone back to his hometown to begin
00:07:46.020 his Rehabilitation from his vertebrange
00:07:48.840 area that's a very sloppy attempted pass
00:07:51.060 [Applause]
00:07:57.919 fernandinho there who gave the ball away
00:08:00.360 but he darted him to make sure there was
00:08:02.759 no dire consequence
00:08:09.919 well Fair now it's only about five feet
00:08:12.419 five so he'd have needed step ladders to
00:08:14.520 get to that
00:08:17.039 here it is a lovely view of the mineral
00:08:19.620 stadium in Bella Horizonte which also
00:08:21.780 staged games in 1950 but not in this
00:08:24.960 particular Stadium
00:08:30.479 that's the most unusual contribution
00:08:32.279 from my Kong
00:08:34.919 but he's a right full back but he was
00:08:36.899 bursting through the center of the field
00:08:40.260 out he would tell you he knew exactly
00:08:42.059 what he was doing the man taking this
00:08:44.339 throw in who's won his place back from
00:08:46.740 Danny Alves
00:08:48.100 [Applause]
00:08:51.080 Julius Caesar
00:08:54.180 to Dante getting his first action in
00:08:56.700 these World Cup finals only he and the
00:09:00.180 reserve Defender Maxwell here the two
00:09:02.220 had not played a part in at least one of
00:09:03.899 the games
00:09:08.459 they've not get got the ball through to
00:09:10.500 Fred at all yet Brazil
00:09:13.560 turning here Sammy kadira An Elegant
00:09:16.380 mover on the ball and he plays it wide
00:09:18.420 danger here to Brazil for the first time
00:09:20.700 in the game allowed to run through by
00:09:23.160 Michael flaps Into the Danger area good
00:09:25.500 block there shout for handball it was
00:09:27.600 kadira's shot
00:09:29.700 Germany will come again
00:09:32.640 both these sides scored early goals in
00:09:35.040 the quarterfinals
00:09:36.790 [Applause]
00:09:39.899 Into the Danger Zone once more but the
00:09:42.180 free kick will be awarded by the Mexican
00:09:44.100 official in favor of the home nation
00:09:48.959 Sammy kadira got the shot through there
00:09:51.959 after urzil's pass into the heart of the
00:09:55.019 penalty area it actually came back off
00:09:57.540 his own man
00:09:59.640 and then a tangler bodies between closer
00:10:01.920 and David Louise
00:10:03.899 but it was Tony Cruz who got in the way
00:10:06.540 of the shot from padira
00:10:10.380 coming up to eight minutes played in the
00:10:12.480 first of the two semi-finals of the FIFA
00:10:14.880 2014 World Cup in Bella Horizonte
00:10:18.120 interception from Hoover diss
00:10:22.019 why desirable Mike I'm intercepted
00:10:24.600 because he uh saw what was on there very
00:10:27.120 sharp thinking from Michael now it's
00:10:29.160 Fred Fred tries to tickle the ball in
00:10:31.320 there for Oscar
00:10:34.140 Schweinsteiger was in the way
00:10:37.080 jamming with an option here
00:10:39.300 important block by David Luiz who has to
00:10:41.820 go racing back again here now though
00:10:45.899 pull back in for kadira and angle pass
00:10:48.959 from him
00:10:51.120 loses out and then tries to grab the
00:10:53.519 player back and did so and the referee
00:10:56.820 might even have thought of a yellow card
00:10:58.560 there against Thomas Muller
00:11:01.560 who's cursing himself because his first
00:11:03.720 touch betrayed him Marcelo took it away
00:11:06.240 he had one little debit to grabbing the
00:11:09.600 shirt of uh Marcelo who then did go to
00:11:12.420 grind
00:11:19.800 time to tie up the lasers
00:11:24.590 [Applause]
00:11:26.700 Brazil scored early through Thiago Silva
00:11:29.339 in their last game against Colombia
00:11:33.740 [Applause]
00:11:37.380 another free kick Brazil's way in
00:11:39.240 against Miroslav Plaza Germany also
00:11:42.240 scored early Max Hummel's goal turned
00:11:44.640 out to be the only goal against the
00:11:46.260 French
00:11:47.519 David Luiz smashes it one side of the
00:11:50.220 field to the other towards Hulk who
00:11:52.800 can't take it down
00:11:55.920 arist and Harrod
00:12:02.480 complete misunderstanding by Marcel
00:12:05.100 Germany have three forward here against
00:12:06.720 only two in defense can Germany get the
00:12:09.360 Breakthrough that the home nation is
00:12:11.339 dreading
00:12:12.600 well they've got numbers back and it was
00:12:14.820 Marcelo came charging back now he says
00:12:17.519 sorry
00:12:20.220 Fortune with him Brazil did not come to
00:12:22.800 grief tennis played nil nil
00:12:27.460 [Applause]
00:12:38.459 Germany's first corner
00:12:41.220 plenty of height on it he's gone through
00:12:43.220 Germany score it's exactly what Brazil
00:12:48.600 was dreading it's almost Muller
00:12:52.500 with his fifth goal of these World Cup
00:12:55.380 finals sent to shiver through the nation
00:13:01.200 [Applause]
00:13:06.060 Brazil nailed Germany won in the 11th
00:13:09.180 minute from their first corner and it's
00:13:11.700 gone all the way through to Muller and
00:13:14.040 nobody picked him up at all
00:13:16.680 gross with the delivery Muller with the
00:13:20.100 side step and he now matches his tally
00:13:22.500 of five goals in South Africa four years
00:13:24.779 ago but it's a sickening moment for
00:13:28.320 Brazil
00:13:31.760 200 million people
00:13:35.040 will have hated that site
00:13:39.300 the Germans here in Bella Horizonte and
00:13:42.360 one ecstatic coach rather enjoyed the
00:13:47.040 side foot of Thomas Muller that
00:13:48.660 dispatched the ball into Brazil's net in
00:13:51.180 the 11th minute
00:13:54.600 Muller's World Cup record just gets
00:13:56.940 better and better
00:13:59.730 [Music]
00:14:04.260 say there he is five goals in six
00:14:06.480 matches that Brazil was dreading an
00:14:08.399 early concession
00:14:09.660 they've got to come from behind they've
00:14:11.639 done it before they were behind against
00:14:13.380 Croatia in the opening game and
00:14:15.240 eventually won three one that was Hulk
00:14:18.120 just prodding the ball out
00:14:21.180 Thomas mullet with a hat-chick against
00:14:23.339 Portugal has also scored now against
00:14:25.380 United States and Brazil in these finals
00:14:28.680 to add to the five goals he was Golden
00:14:30.959 Shoe winner remember in South Africa so
00:14:33.720 he has 10 World Cup goals in a very
00:14:37.200 short career
00:14:39.420 David Louise
00:14:41.600 this will be a test of the home nation
00:14:52.980 and they've no Captain and Thiago
00:14:58.260 suspended
00:15:00.660 what they do have is 78 minutes on the
00:15:03.420 clock in which to do something about it
00:15:05.040 in which to Strike Back
00:15:07.530 [Applause]
00:15:19.860 it's not a bad flick on either in
00:15:21.720 Germany come again with Muller at the
00:15:23.519 heart of things once more now David Luiz
00:15:26.100 does step in he strides him perishly
00:15:28.380 through the Midfield the option on his
00:15:30.899 left gift provided by Hulk a good ball
00:15:33.120 in here and there could be something on
00:15:35.040 for Brazil oh it took a tickle off the
00:15:37.560 foot of one of the German defense
00:15:39.860 otherwise it might now be one a piece on
00:15:43.620 the Brazilian commentators would be in
00:15:45.300 raptures around me
00:15:47.160 as it is it's a free kick for Germany
00:15:52.139 a slightly chilling statistic for our
00:15:55.139 South American friends is that Germany
00:15:56.820 are unbeaten in their last four World
00:15:58.500 Cup matches against South American
00:15:59.880 opposition since losing the 2002 final
00:16:03.240 to Brazil
00:16:04.410 [Applause]
00:16:07.500 and that loss was their only one of the
00:16:09.720 last nine World Cup games against South
00:16:11.760 American sides since losing the 1986
00:16:14.940 final to Argentina
00:16:19.980 they are ominously redoubtable opponents
00:16:23.560 [Applause]
00:16:25.740 somehow know how to win football matches
00:16:29.880 and so de Brazil
00:16:34.740 in fact if you want a statistic to
00:16:36.360 redress the balance Brazil uh
00:16:38.339 unbeatening 42 home games since 2002
00:16:42.360 against Paraguay and in 63 home
00:16:45.959 competitive games since they lost to
00:16:47.820 Peru in would you believe
00:16:50.120 1975. they'll need better passes than
00:16:53.519 that one from Hulk
00:16:59.759 thank you
00:17:05.160 Brazil have been training in the
00:17:06.720 mountains in terosopolis
00:17:11.400 and uh it's a relatively cool day here
00:17:14.099 in Belo Horizonte
00:17:17.339 to some of the very hot temperatures
00:17:19.319 we've had with the one o'clock kickoffs
00:17:21.000 five o'clock here the kickoff by the way
00:17:22.619 or if you're watching around the world
00:17:28.020 and there is a little fella Bernard who
00:17:30.419 plays for jonetsk these days but played
00:17:33.600 here in Bella horizontally at this
00:17:35.460 stadium for Atletico Monero prior to
00:17:37.740 moving there
00:17:38.960 [Applause]
00:17:46.860 Brazil nil Germany won with quarter of
00:17:49.799 an hour gone
00:17:50.760 Muller's header and then another header
00:17:53.520 on from kadira
00:17:56.940 David Luis
00:18:00.179 more of a hopeful pump than anything
00:18:01.799 else
00:18:07.280 rather lazy from him for once
00:18:11.160 so Michael
00:18:17.160 Bernard Michael continues his Gallop
00:18:19.500 there's only one Brazilian across in the
00:18:21.600 center though and mikon just played the
00:18:23.880 ball straight against Hummel's legs
00:18:26.860 [Applause]
00:18:34.260 does he I've been just about everywhere
00:18:36.960 else during this tour of Brazil in the
00:18:39.419 World Cup finals and it's just a very
00:18:40.799 big country
00:18:41.820 we can all venture this
00:18:44.480 Oscar now Dante
00:18:49.410 [Applause]
00:18:54.200 fernandinho made himself available no
00:18:56.760 foulware but Oscar with a second chance
00:18:59.160 does play Hulk forward now here's the
00:19:01.919 big chance for Brazil is this a penalty
00:19:03.900 kick
00:19:04.679 no it's a corner kid
00:19:05.930 [Applause]
00:19:08.160 and there's an immediate response here
00:19:10.740 between players who decide to take the
00:19:12.960 Lloyd to their own hands Mueller is
00:19:14.880 trying to act as Peacemaker Luis Gustavo
00:19:17.700 is only just back from suspension he's
00:19:20.280 also heatedly involved as his botany
00:19:25.080 this will be an interesting one the
00:19:27.000 Mexican referee immediately pointed for
00:19:29.580 a corner and not to the Penalty spot so
00:19:32.400 there's no question of him reversing his
00:19:33.960 decision
00:19:35.460 and uh is the one who is told to calm
00:19:39.360 down along with Marcelo here we have it
00:19:41.460 Marcelo
00:19:47.580 challenge Marcelo immediately thought
00:19:49.440 penalty kick he got a shove in the chest
00:19:51.660 from botay he gave him a little push
00:19:53.580 back
00:19:54.840 and it was uh or amicably sorted out in
00:19:58.140 the end
00:20:02.460 and that's not a bad ball in for Oscar
00:20:04.679 taking on the chest he'll weave around
00:20:07.260 and cross the ball in it's lifted up
00:20:09.539 into the air to safety for the Moment by
00:20:11.460 hummus
00:20:19.559 Micon
00:20:22.620 [Applause]
00:20:26.640 there's been a 11 penalties so far in
00:20:29.100 these World Cup finals 10 of them scored
00:20:31.440 in only one missed
00:20:33.600 the tally was not Addicted by the
00:20:35.820 Mexican official there as Germany break
00:20:38.100 here dangerously with Muller it's uh oh
00:20:41.280 as well there but the back heel of a mic
00:20:43.799 on not only snubbed out the German move
00:20:47.340 but got his own team dashing forward and
00:20:50.460 the shape now of Marcelo
00:20:53.900 fernandinho the portents are good for
00:20:56.580 the game at the moment what Brazil must
00:20:59.280 not do is of course concede a second
00:21:01.020 goal
00:21:05.820 it's a very open contest
00:21:13.940 free kick Brazil
00:21:20.050 [Applause]
00:21:26.470 [Applause]
00:21:35.940 I do believe the goal from Thomas mullet
00:21:38.520 is the 2000 International goal scored by
00:21:41.520 Germany
00:21:43.740 statistic
00:21:45.299 there are so many about this game
00:21:47.760 and of course the one man who wants a
00:21:49.320 goal today is Miller slav closer
00:21:54.059 he's level with Ronaldo the Brazilian
00:21:56.580 Ronaldo
00:21:57.780 with 15 International goals having
00:21:59.700 scored here in these finals against
00:22:01.380 Garner
00:22:04.740 this is Mike on for Brazil
00:22:07.440 not a bad little ball in there but Oscar
00:22:09.840 couldn't take it
00:22:11.880 so Schweinsteiger is playing a very deep
00:22:14.280 role today
00:22:17.100 shuffles the ball forward surely it
00:22:19.080 looks as though that one went out
00:22:22.080 great well the referee's assistant said
00:22:24.539 it didn't
00:22:27.900 have been an inquest if Germany had gone
00:22:30.120 on to score a second goal they lead by
00:22:31.860 one
00:22:36.299 breaks here
00:22:39.480 and uh
00:22:41.520 about four inclusive tenders to him all
00:22:44.760 in yellow shirts nothing about closure
00:22:47.220 is today he's uh second in the all-time
00:22:51.000 World Cup appearance list along with
00:22:53.640 Paolo Maldini with only lotha Matthias
00:22:56.400 having played more games in the finals
00:23:00.600 so closest as he wants to go out
00:23:03.480 in the finals he'll retire from
00:23:05.580 International Football
00:23:07.140 these World Cup finals at the age of 36.
00:23:12.980 Germany do look dangerous every time
00:23:15.120 they attack and khadir is in a handy
00:23:17.460 position here just outside the 18-yard
00:23:19.679 area
00:23:21.120 this will be picked up gathered in
00:23:23.640 comfortably by Julio Cesar there is
00:23:26.760 Moose left closer
00:23:28.620 Germany have never lost a match when he
00:23:31.260 scored a goal and he's played in 70
00:23:34.080 played in 135 games and scored 70 goals
00:23:37.620 at some some tally Oscar for Brazil
00:23:41.580 coming up to the Midway point of the
00:23:43.500 opening half in Bella horizontal
00:23:46.410 [Applause]
00:23:52.500 a seller does really well there that was
00:23:54.539 great technique to keep that ball in
00:23:56.159 play and to find Hulk
00:24:00.960 it says Germany break again here this is
00:24:03.360 when they really do look ominously
00:24:05.159 dangerous
00:24:06.960 and uh although this is cut back they
00:24:08.940 will have a throw in
00:24:11.220 saving by Dante Thomas mullet is
00:24:14.280 reveling in the freedom he's getting
00:24:15.840 down that right touchline at the moment
00:24:18.240 he's also got the one goal of the game
00:24:20.100 so far
00:24:24.299 staking defensive
00:24:29.880 real trouble they're in dire trouble now
00:24:33.000 we have a World Cup record
00:24:36.960 supplied by Miro slab closer
00:24:41.100 goal number 16 in His World Cup career
00:24:44.940 Yogi love side the two goals to the good
00:24:48.500 Scolari is looking for a hiding place
00:24:52.210 [Applause]
00:24:54.720 well they were all at Sea were the
00:24:57.780 Brazilian defense here
00:25:00.000 when Germany took advantage there it got
00:25:03.720 through
00:25:04.980 to cross closer had one chance he didn't
00:25:08.640 miss the second time around Muller was
00:25:11.460 also in there
00:25:13.020 Julio Cesar could do no better than
00:25:15.539 parry and Miroslav closer as not just
00:25:18.840 his second goal of these World Cup
00:25:20.640 finals he's now one better than the
00:25:23.340 great Ronaldo in all-time scoring charts
00:25:26.700 with his 16th World Cup finals goal
00:25:30.900 and what it all adds up to is a
00:25:33.419 scoreline of Brazil nil Germany two and
00:25:38.039 we're only halfway through the first
00:25:40.080 half
00:25:41.940 cheers from Brazilian fans already
00:25:44.580 there's a long way to go maybe here now
00:25:47.340 Bernard
00:25:49.980 quite
00:25:55.200 well football can be a cruel game
00:25:57.539 Bernard it just got away from him there
00:26:00.539 the one game that Brazil did not want to
00:26:03.059 play in here in their own country was
00:26:05.039 the third fourth playoff match
00:26:07.860 but that's where they're destined to go
00:26:09.779 to Brasilia at the moment
00:26:12.200 for the match on Saturday
00:26:15.240 and uh Germany looking good for the
00:26:17.520 final on Sunday they might get another
00:26:18.900 one
00:26:19.980 it's three nil it's a rump for the
00:26:22.980 Germans the game maybe one and lost
00:26:26.039 inside 25 minutes plants to the left
00:26:29.340 foot of Tony Cruz
00:26:32.039 the Brazilians are in disbelief they are
00:26:35.640 stunned they have come here for a Samba
00:26:38.580 and they have been totally rocked back
00:26:41.340 on their Heels by the almost formidable
00:26:44.220 Germans just look at the faces
00:26:48.240 the Brazilians are crestfallen
00:26:51.539 Brazil played it into that position it
00:26:54.179 was cut back in where was the Brazilian
00:26:56.279 defense
00:26:57.720 Julio Cesar was totally exposed the left
00:27:02.100 foot of Tony Cruz may have just hammered
00:27:06.299 Germany into the final of the World Cup
00:27:08.520 2014.
00:27:11.340 what a scoreline for me to deliver from
00:27:14.760 Bella Horizonte 25 minutes played Brazil
00:27:19.080 nil Germany three
00:27:23.700 oh it might get worse this is from four
00:27:26.299 this is quite astonishing it's all over
00:27:29.580 now it really is all over for Brazil
00:27:35.039 two for Krauss in two minutes
00:27:39.120 it's a disaster the little boy is crying
00:27:42.600 his eyes out a whole nation is in
00:27:46.919 disbelief stunned into silence
00:27:51.179 can seventy thousand people be silent
00:27:53.760 well they are now because Tony Cross has
00:27:56.820 scored not one but two goals in two
00:27:59.880 minutes his first in the World Cup
00:28:01.620 finals
00:28:03.360 it's a disaster day for Brazilian
00:28:05.760 football
00:28:07.400 kadira Krauss the goalkeeper nowhere
00:28:10.620 it's all over
00:28:13.760 [Applause]
00:28:15.000 Tony Cross on the day he wins cat number
00:28:17.880 50 scores goals number six and seven in
00:28:21.059 the space of two minutes
00:28:27.840 no words are necessary over shots like
00:28:30.480 that one
00:28:33.750 [Music]
00:28:38.640 publishing scoreline I've ever had to
00:28:41.159 give out
00:28:43.740 Brazil the hill Germany four
00:28:48.120 I won't say there are fans leaving the
00:28:50.460 stadium but they probably feel as though
00:28:52.320 they might as well
00:28:56.700 and the way Brazil has caved in has been
00:29:00.240 beyond belief
00:29:02.279 Carlos on 24 and 26 minutes
00:29:05.940 has just ended a World Cup dream and
00:29:08.880 it's 1950 all over again except this is
00:29:12.240 the semi-final and not even the final
00:29:24.520 [Applause]
00:29:27.000 what can they do from here if we're
00:29:30.240 Brazil were to come back and win this I
00:29:32.520 would say it would be probably the
00:29:35.399 greatest comeback of all time in a
00:29:37.320 football match
00:29:40.500 can it possibly be Hulk they need
00:29:43.140 something just to give them a lift
00:29:45.840 they must be so demoralized those
00:29:48.059 players in the canary yellow and blue
00:29:51.559 fernandinho's trying to give them
00:29:53.100 something here it's a scrap to feed off
00:29:55.500 Micon
00:30:01.679 do you remember those statistics Brazil
00:30:04.500 unbeaten in 42 home games since 2002.
00:30:08.520 they might have a free kick here no they
00:30:11.100 won't it's only a goal kick nothing is
00:30:13.320 going their way
00:30:16.799 Brazil we have another look here at uh
00:30:19.740 Hulk going to ground he hurtled over the
00:30:22.260 leg
00:30:23.100 no feet no free kick correct decision
00:30:27.539 and Brazil have not lost a competitive
00:30:29.460 home game in 63 matches since 1975.
00:30:34.880 39 years on
00:30:38.100 it's almost certain they're going to
00:30:39.659 lose the next one
00:30:51.899 just one other little statistic for you
00:30:54.000 Brazil began the day with 220 World Cup
00:30:57.299 game goals to their name Germany 216.
00:31:01.140 they've drawn level in the space of 26
00:31:03.600 minutes
00:31:04.740 and they're here again there's three
00:31:06.659 forward
00:31:07.700 kadira
00:31:09.320 they're queuing up they're all going to
00:31:12.179 score it this rate
00:31:13.880 kadira the latest name on the score
00:31:16.740 sheet and the Brazilians look as though
00:31:19.679 they want to go to the dressing room
00:31:22.440 already
00:31:24.000 there is no hiding place
00:31:26.700 for this rampant German side
00:31:30.539 what on Earth can skawari do about this
00:31:34.679 it's the biggest test of History just so
00:31:37.080 many red and black shirts around
00:31:39.320 Brazil totally all at Sea ersil it's
00:31:42.659 like who wants it next who wants to
00:31:45.000 score a goal Sama kidira Turner I think
00:31:48.000 it's my turn Why Not Me ursul gave him
00:31:51.000 the chance
00:31:52.260 Ernie tucked it away with some relish
00:31:55.740 Brazil nil Germany five
00:32:02.399 we're equally top score in these World
00:32:05.039 Cup finals remember the Dutch beat Spain
00:32:07.380 by five goals to one julius's arm must
00:32:10.500 be
00:32:11.580 wondering what an Earth is going on in
00:32:13.740 front of him there
00:32:16.279 kadira's first World Cup goal here he
00:32:18.720 scored one against Uruguay in South
00:32:20.580 Africa four years ago but if anybody had
00:32:23.700 said to anybody else today it'll be five
00:32:26.760 nil before we've been playing for half
00:32:28.500 an hour they'd have been put in a
00:32:30.240 lunatic asylum
00:32:32.760 Brazil nil Germany five I repeat
00:32:43.500 utter cruise to kadira if your name
00:32:46.980 begins with a K you're likely to get a
00:32:49.320 goal here today
00:32:57.539 now here's a funny one for you Brazil
00:32:59.580 have had 55 of The Possession
00:33:02.460 doesn't really count for much does it
00:33:04.200 when you're five goals down
00:33:06.840 anybody wanted to see this to be fair
00:33:08.760 well I suppose the German fans did
00:33:12.299 well those who've gathered here in Bella
00:33:14.700 Horizonte will be regarding this as
00:33:17.640 their favorite holiday destination of
00:33:19.679 the future
00:33:30.620 if you cast your minds back to 1990 well
00:33:34.559 there we have a very very very sad shot
00:33:37.440 that's Thiago the captain of Brazil who
00:33:40.140 must be wondering if it would have been
00:33:41.640 different if he'd been there and you do
00:33:43.500 have to ponder that question because
00:33:45.600 Dante and David Louise have looked very
00:33:48.720 uncomfortable in one another's company
00:33:50.340 at the heart of the Brazilian defense
00:33:52.200 today here come the Germans yet again oh
00:33:55.980 it's deflected wide fortunately
00:33:58.200 otherwise I'd have been saying six nil
00:34:02.159 in 1998 Brazil lost three nil in the
00:34:05.159 final to France in Paris that was
00:34:07.860 hitherto the previous worst defeat it
00:34:10.440 could have just got worse still for the
00:34:12.780 sixth goal
00:34:22.139 that the Germans just look irresistible
00:34:25.918 and I wouldn't imagine that the
00:34:27.480 Netherlands in Argentina are enjoying
00:34:29.219 watching this performance
00:34:32.099 they play tomorrow in Sao Paulo
00:34:37.440 as though the Germans have been
00:34:42.719 a number of goals in the World Cup
00:34:44.099 finals you have to say some of the
00:34:46.440 Brazilian defending has been shoddy at
00:34:49.199 least
00:34:50.879 they're at best
00:34:55.739 it's a truly horrific score line which
00:34:58.260 will be greeted with disbelief around
00:35:00.240 the world
00:35:01.400 free kick Germany now
00:35:05.099 well they must clearly be exasperated
00:35:06.960 David Louise has gone
00:35:09.240 to apologize
00:35:12.420 to Thomas Muller
00:35:24.900 well the Brazilian players arrived today
00:35:27.359 all wearing baseball caps with the
00:35:29.760 message horse Neymar wishing their best
00:35:33.359 to the stricken Striker
00:35:36.119 boy are they missing him and boy are
00:35:38.220 they missing Thiago in defense as well
00:35:40.200 and Germany have exploited that to the
00:35:42.720 full
00:35:47.820 you almost don't want Germany to score
00:35:49.619 again it would be so humiliating for
00:35:51.420 Brazil but they might it might just get
00:35:53.579 worse
00:35:54.839 it's a goal kick
00:35:58.800 strange way you wonder what an earth
00:36:00.900 jock him low Lord will say to his
00:36:03.300 players in the dressing room in fact
00:36:05.339 mirislav closer creating history with
00:36:07.920 his 16th World Cup finals goal on his
00:36:11.240 136th appearance his 71st goal of his
00:36:16.500 International career
00:36:20.579 and I think that statistic about Germany
00:36:23.040 never having lost when closer has scored
00:36:25.079 is pretty safe today
00:36:26.700 he's on the ball again now middle slap
00:36:28.859 closer continues on the gallop four
00:36:31.200 Germans up against three Defenders
00:36:33.599 but uh an Aaron pass for once
00:36:37.460 fernandinho to Hulk
00:36:43.380 well imagine if you're skillari and
00:36:45.359 thinking of a substitute could you
00:36:46.680 imagine saying to somebody go on go and
00:36:48.599 win us the game go and score us six
00:36:50.400 goals
00:36:51.810 [Applause]
00:36:53.339 not something I think that he will be
00:36:55.079 saying so the likes of uh Jill or
00:36:57.839 paulinho or William
00:36:59.090 [Applause]
00:37:10.020 Germany have also kept three clean
00:37:12.060 sheets in this world cup so far and they
00:37:14.579 joined most along with Argentina Costa
00:37:16.680 Rica and France
00:37:18.480 so Brazil at least we'll hope to get one
00:37:20.220 goal to Dent that record but they're
00:37:22.380 back on the defensive again
00:37:27.540 could also is such a vital player for
00:37:29.700 Germany stabbing this one to Brazil but
00:37:31.859 then it's a closer it all fell down
00:37:38.339 the Crowder
00:37:39.900 I can't say silent because that will be
00:37:41.820 wrong but they just don't know what to
00:37:43.320 make of this at all
00:37:45.960 nobody but nobody could have come here
00:37:47.880 today expected to witness the Carnage
00:37:51.119 that we've seen
00:37:52.859 two minutes to go to Half Time Brazil
00:37:55.380 nil Germany five
00:38:02.599 what's going on
00:38:04.619 he's not had a shot to stop
00:38:09.839 Brazil have sofa made his one shot
00:38:12.660 it was not on goal
00:38:14.400 Germany have had nine every one of the
00:38:17.520 nine was on the target
00:38:22.380 for a 10th through vividis
00:38:25.500 shulker
00:38:27.599 Ozil
00:38:29.820 that looks to me panic in the Brazilian
00:38:31.560 ranks every time the Germans move
00:38:33.240 forward in numbers as a unit as they do
00:38:36.060 now
00:38:47.339 Germany's 12th semi-final match in the
00:38:50.339 13th time in the final four of the World
00:38:52.619 Cup
00:38:55.079 they've lost their last two semi-final
00:38:57.240 matches without scoring
00:38:59.700 Spain in 2010 and to Italy in 2006 but I
00:39:04.740 can't see them losing this one somehow
00:39:06.859 mistakes continued to be made by that
00:39:09.420 Brazilian defense which is just either
00:39:11.400 coughing The Possession up or not
00:39:13.500 getting in on people not defending at
00:39:15.960 all cross who's on a hat-trick remember
00:39:20.640 just look how many Germans are around
00:39:22.440 the edge of the Brazilian penalty area
00:39:24.300 here they're queuing up and they have a
00:39:26.700 free kick now
00:39:29.099 Luis Gustavo
00:39:31.320 there's disconsolate it won't be
00:39:34.260 surprising if some Brazilian heads go
00:39:36.119 down
00:39:37.260 where is Gustavo and Muller
00:39:42.060 and you wonder how on Earth they're
00:39:43.619 going to react on Saturday when they
00:39:45.240 have to play in Brasilia in the third
00:39:47.040 fourth playoff game
00:39:51.960 Victory 1950 Revisited
00:39:56.460 defeat against Uruguay in the final of
00:39:58.800 that year by two goals to one
00:40:01.140 has haunted the prospects all the way
00:40:03.720 through this campaign they've always
00:40:05.220 been worried about that happening again
00:40:08.099 well they never thought that this could
00:40:09.599 possibly happen on semi-final day
00:40:13.440 which is our schweinster gave good
00:40:15.240 choice look though it's a left footed
00:40:16.859 one clicked over the top of the bar
00:40:19.560 by Ozil
00:40:22.440 the one they call Nemo because of his
00:40:24.540 resemblance to a cartoon character
00:40:29.700 for once Germany didn't get it right
00:40:31.440 their first shot off the target out of
00:40:33.780 10. I can't remember the last attack
00:40:35.820 Brazil had
00:40:40.740 Yogi love is coming for some criticism
00:40:42.900 in certain quarters in Germany he's
00:40:45.359 never won a title of course he was
00:40:47.040 assistant
00:40:48.480 to Jurgen Klinsmann in 2006 when Germany
00:40:52.140 finished third
00:40:54.119 he's not been able to win a European
00:40:55.800 championship
00:40:58.680 but he stands on the threshold of taking
00:41:00.540 his country into their first Finals
00:41:03.480 since winning the World Cup in 2002.
00:41:07.020 in Yokohama against today's opposition
00:41:14.099 Germany's last win was back in 1990 in
00:41:16.680 Italy courtesy of Andy bremus go
00:41:20.540 against Argentina
00:41:33.180 such a one-sided contest foreign
00:41:36.660 something nobody but nobody envisaged
00:41:47.760 closer back for cross and then for
00:41:50.880 kadira
00:41:53.339 probably enough Germany have never lost
00:41:54.900 to World Cup hosts since England in 1966
00:41:57.960 in the final and they played most house
00:41:59.760 since then
00:42:01.079 well that's something Brazil if I'm
00:42:03.180 afraid quite wretched attempted forward
00:42:05.520 ball from fernandino
00:42:08.040 and in truth scholari could make three
00:42:10.560 substitutions at half time and it would
00:42:12.420 still make no difference
00:42:15.480 gross
00:42:18.480 40 minutes played Brazil nil Germany
00:42:21.359 five
00:42:24.839 and that's not a misread or a misprint
00:42:27.720 or anything and they're looking for
00:42:28.740 number six here this time ganty is in
00:42:31.320 the way but
00:42:32.700 still struggle to retain The Possession
00:42:34.920 it's also they've forgotten how to play
00:42:42.359 Hulk
00:42:46.420 [Applause]
00:42:48.619 they must be just so crestful and so
00:42:52.200 disconsolate what on Earth the scalari
00:42:54.420 say in the dressing at half time
00:42:56.780 Bernard unable to get through there
00:42:59.220 kadira
00:43:01.800 and he is dispossessed by the
00:43:03.720 enthusiastic Marcelo Brazil just need at
00:43:06.839 least a goal to give them a smattering
00:43:08.880 of not exactly hope but of comfort
00:43:15.540 but they've left themselves utterly
00:43:17.460 exposed defensively today
00:43:20.640 they were able to cope with the German
00:43:23.579 play
00:43:26.160 clinical finishing
00:43:29.160 some of it has to be said was down to
00:43:31.140 Awful defending now Brazil have a chance
00:43:33.180 Oscar into the German penalty area shot
00:43:36.180 blocked
00:43:37.260 breaks the Bernard
00:43:42.839 Oscar once again wriggling and writhing
00:43:45.000 his way through into a good position but
00:43:47.099 this is where the Brazilians are
00:43:49.020 vulnerable on the German counter-attacks
00:43:52.020 they use width so well they have the
00:43:55.200 width supplied by Massachusetts
00:43:56.660 accompanied by Bastian Schweinsteiger
00:43:59.220 then by Johnny Cruz
00:44:02.040 with the once sprays the pass errantly
00:44:10.619 Brazil cannot wait to get into the
00:44:12.780 sanctuary of their dressing room
00:44:15.119 they have three minutes for a little bit
00:44:16.740 of added time in which to do that
00:44:22.830 [Applause]
00:44:28.500 foreign
00:44:36.500 ER he's really enhanced his reputation
00:44:39.480 at these World Cup finals as Tony Cross
00:44:41.640 the Bayern Munich midfielder
00:44:48.480 Muller
00:44:51.140 Lam playing in the right full-back
00:44:53.460 position today started the tournament in
00:44:55.560 a Midfield role
00:44:58.440 is back to giulio cesari who must wonder
00:45:00.900 what on Earth has hit him today
00:45:05.339 only managed one clean sheet in the
00:45:07.140 tournament and that has to proved
00:45:08.520 Brazil's vulnerability
00:45:19.079 before today Brazil it scored 10 and
00:45:21.119 conceded four it's now 10-9 but they're
00:45:24.900 looking for goal number 10 or goal
00:45:26.760 number 11 of their own here with hook to
00:45:29.280 the four
00:45:32.700 and Brazil do have a free kick he's
00:45:34.619 almost as though nobody cares now it
00:45:36.359 doesn't matter
00:45:37.800 the game was won and lost by the 24th
00:45:40.619 minute
00:45:41.940 quite incredible as we look again here
00:45:44.040 at Bernard heading the ball and kadira
00:45:46.140 going across him
00:45:47.460 Germany scored four goals in six minutes
00:45:51.359 May well be something of a a World Cup
00:45:53.880 record as well
00:45:55.440 closer on 23 gross on 24 and again on 26
00:45:59.700 kadira on 29.
00:46:04.920 by which time I'm sure a lot of
00:46:06.780 television sets had been switched off in
00:46:08.520 Brazil
00:46:15.000 the ball is in here but uh
00:46:18.420 it would be really cruel if Germany
00:46:20.700 scored again before half time they fall
00:46:23.760 forward again obviously Michael manages
00:46:26.880 to intercept that intended pass
00:46:44.940 Muller's early goal was bad enough on 11
00:46:46.980 minutes but the subsequent minutes have
00:46:49.680 just destroyed all belief that Brazil
00:46:52.500 have
00:46:54.540 this one is launched towards Fred I
00:46:56.640 can't remember Fred being involved in
00:46:58.260 the game at all and he's not involved
00:47:00.300 here either because the ball goes beyond
00:47:02.040 him and for the first time the booing
00:47:05.579 Around The Stadium from the Brazilian
00:47:07.380 supporters
00:47:09.900 he must have hated what they've seen
00:47:11.460 today now
00:47:20.339 backs to the wall again as we move to
00:47:22.440 the 45-minute Mark with one to be added
00:47:31.440 Germany will settle for this
00:47:33.600 [Music]
00:47:37.020 David Luiz
00:47:38.940 so much a hero so much has been written
00:47:41.160 about the
00:47:42.480 Defender moving from Chelsea to Paris
00:47:44.700 Saint-Germain this summer
00:47:47.819 I'm saying he could put up for election
00:47:49.260 at the moment and he'd be voted in as
00:47:51.060 president he's been so popular
00:47:54.599 I'm afraid nobody in the yellow shirt is
00:47:56.579 popular at the moment
00:47:59.900 scalari stands helplessly in the
00:48:02.220 technical Zone
00:48:09.839 right run that does show some Spirit
00:48:11.460 from Hulk but he can't keep the ball in
00:48:14.700 Scolari was the Portugal coach when they
00:48:16.859 lost to Germany in the third fourth
00:48:18.420 playoff match
00:48:24.530 [Applause]
00:48:27.540 well this was just one of the goals the
00:48:29.579 last one from Sami kadira
00:48:32.099 maybe a slight question of offside there
00:48:34.380 but there's no question about who's
00:48:36.000 going to win this match
00:48:38.040 the scoreline has to be repeated that
00:48:41.460 face tells it all Muller got the first
00:48:43.920 goal in the 11th minute Miller slap
00:48:46.859 closer there taking congratulations for
00:48:49.020 setting up a new World Cup record got
00:48:50.760 the second the carnival continued for
00:48:53.160 the Germans with a couple of cross goals
00:48:55.079 and kadira got the fifth there'll be no
00:48:57.420 Samba in Bella Horizonte Tonight It's
00:49:00.240 Brazil nil Germany five
00:49:03.050 [Applause]
00:49:05.440 [Music]
00:49:10.280 so it's the second half of the first of
00:49:12.720 the two semi-finals of the FIFA World
00:49:14.520 Cup of 2014 Brazil and Germany
00:49:18.480 the latter leading by five goals to nil
00:49:20.760 the Europeans against the South American
00:49:22.560 hosts
00:49:29.620 [Music]
00:49:31.440 well I think the one thing that we're
00:49:33.300 pretty emphatic about is there won't be
00:49:34.920 a penalty shootout required today there
00:49:37.140 will be a free kick immediately here for
00:49:39.060 Brazil
00:49:42.599 against the cross who've scored two of
00:49:45.780 the five goals
00:49:48.599 Marcelo now for Brazil
00:49:54.599 that is the situation of the match
00:49:57.960 if you're wondering Brazil's record
00:49:59.940 defeats came all of uh 94 years ago
00:50:06.780 when they were beaten six nil by Uruguay
00:50:09.560 Ramirez the Chelsea Midfield player
00:50:14.099 on in place
00:50:15.980 of Hulk
00:50:18.359 who's not got a goal in these finals
00:50:21.480 and fernandinho who was caught ball
00:50:24.300 watching at least twice and punished
00:50:26.940 twice in the first half has been
00:50:28.560 replaced by paulinho
00:50:33.150 [Applause]
00:50:34.500 if Germany can retain them Amanda
00:50:39.079 sort of Lumbers onto the ball a bit here
00:50:42.359 challenged by murtazakat
00:50:46.520 Marcelo Ford in here for uh Ramirez
00:50:52.619 well it would be nice to see at least
00:50:54.059 one Brazilian girl to give the crown
00:50:55.680 something to cheer about and take home
00:50:59.040 as a souvenir from this semi-final
00:51:02.700 it was here of course that Brazil beat
00:51:04.500 Chile they knocked them out in a penalty
00:51:06.300 shootout after a 1-1 score line
00:51:09.240 so they came here with very happy
00:51:10.800 memories of this Stadium
00:51:20.579 it would appear that the European side
00:51:22.319 is destined to play in an eighth final
00:51:25.800 they've won three they've lost four
00:51:33.359 angle of bodies here with Luis Gustavo
00:51:35.819 who plays his Club football in Germany
00:51:37.619 of course at Wolfsburg
00:51:39.980 my principal ergosa
00:51:45.180 Lam the captain of Germany I bet he
00:51:47.400 can't believe this situation either but
00:51:50.040 he must be thinking of the possibility
00:51:51.960 of stepping up to receive the World Cup
00:51:55.020 in Sunday's Final in Rio
00:52:01.500 so whether it will be the Netherlands or
00:52:03.720 Argentina we shall find out tomorrow
00:52:09.540 something quite extraordinary is
00:52:11.220 required for it not to be Germany in
00:52:13.800 that final
00:52:15.240 Louise who also had a torrid first half
00:52:18.300 having been imperious throughout the
00:52:20.400 competition hither too
00:52:21.460 [Applause]
00:52:27.300 that is David Louise and that's the best
00:52:29.280 ball he's played so far today does
00:52:31.980 release Mike on and here is the cross
00:52:33.599 aimed at Fred chance for Oscar here and
00:52:36.540 down he goes no penalty kick
00:52:40.079 thing he tried to win one to be fair he
00:52:41.880 took a tumble but never any question of
00:52:44.579 a penalty to be given it's back in
00:52:46.500 towards Fred now
00:52:48.480 and again the Brazilian goes down and
00:52:51.480 again there is no point of the finger
00:52:53.700 from the official
00:52:56.059 per mirtazaka the tall number 17.
00:53:03.000 this is where Oscar went to ground
00:53:06.000 it's almost a ran into poeteng
00:53:12.670 [Applause]
00:53:18.720 [Applause]
00:53:22.500 although began you may remember with a
00:53:24.300 four-nil Triumph against Portugal the
00:53:26.099 hat trick in that match from Thomas
00:53:28.619 mullet and a girl from center-back
00:53:30.480 matsumos
00:53:32.059 Bernard can't get a meaningful touch on
00:53:34.800 the ball
00:53:36.480 they continued with a 2-2 draw against
00:53:38.520 Garner the matches in which uh middle
00:53:41.040 scored
00:53:43.380 here is the statistic of possession
00:53:45.300 which shows that Brazil is still
00:53:46.800 enjoying a greater share of the ball
00:53:49.559 but the shots on goal is telling
00:53:53.880 Luis Gustavo Paulino
00:54:02.460 David Luiz always willing to stride
00:54:04.740 forward and scored with a 30-yard free
00:54:07.079 kick in the last game
00:54:12.059 and Marcelo up to chase after them to
00:54:14.819 get the possession and then paulinho a
00:54:17.160 better start by Brazil to this half it
00:54:19.140 could hardly have been worse could it
00:54:20.940 knocked in by Bernard long and uh Neuer
00:54:24.000 got a finger on it
00:54:25.920 whoever this launched the ball forward
00:54:31.260 closer
00:54:32.520 beating away Dante
00:54:37.140 Marcelo
00:54:41.099 everyone else good not a good touch
00:54:43.020 really but a shot and a chance for Fred
00:54:45.780 maybe it is Fred slides it through that
00:54:48.780 three forward here
00:54:50.700 the ball didn't reach Oscar when it
00:54:52.680 should have done it was uh meant to
00:54:54.420 reach him from Ramirez
00:55:01.859 for once it was Germany was surviving
00:55:04.559 there with Brazil seemingly having the
00:55:07.140 advantage in numbers
00:55:09.599 well there is a chance for Brazil going
00:55:11.520 up for almost the first time today I
00:55:13.740 think
00:55:17.640 five minutes played in the second half
00:55:19.559 the scoreline unaltered
00:55:23.460 this was the move
00:55:26.099 ment there Fred taking it down trying to
00:55:28.619 weave into position and then the goal
00:55:30.359 looks certain and it would have been a
00:55:31.859 goal that it got through as far as Oscar
00:55:34.200 from the Ramirez pass but uh Neuer
00:55:37.500 stretched the glove
00:55:53.460 spirited running from Bernard
00:55:55.319 accompanied by Marcelo plenty of yellow
00:55:58.079 shirts around the edge of the area here
00:55:59.940 it's Ramirez surely they're going to get
00:56:02.099 one out there Ramirez again no annoya
00:56:04.619 once again foyles Brazil Who at least
00:56:07.559 have come out showing some Stout hearts
00:56:13.380 well they look certain to score not just
00:56:16.020 once but twice in these opening minutes
00:56:17.640 but for Manuel Neuer there
00:56:21.480 Ramirez appears to have made some impact
00:56:24.980 back again here now
00:56:28.339 but it's in a more forward position that
00:56:31.079 he's really made a big impact
00:56:36.059 Luis Gustavo
00:56:37.859 Marcelo asking for the ball in a wide
00:56:39.900 position left in fact it goes even
00:56:41.640 further away to Bernard
00:56:44.640 still Bernard it was a tricky little
00:56:46.440 Winger
00:56:47.520 and that will be a
00:56:49.619 corner
00:56:51.540 first of the half for Brazil
00:56:54.960 Muller contests it
00:56:59.099 only the second of the game they got to
00:57:01.200 an early one in the first half as well
00:57:03.780 and Bernard will take this corner for
00:57:05.460 Brazil looking for a consolation goal
00:57:07.500 this early once again Noyes there with
00:57:10.079 the fist
00:57:11.180 Marcelo however
00:57:13.859 shot blocked
00:57:17.180 Ramirez gets it through here paulinho
00:57:21.800 ya Paulino
00:57:23.880 ya going to be beaten today
00:57:27.300 that is the question I'm not quite sure
00:57:29.460 why he's complaining to the referee
00:57:31.760 paulinho was definitely on side as he
00:57:35.099 broke into the penalty area there but
00:57:37.200 Neuer foiled him not once but twice
00:57:40.440 it's been that sort of day for Brazil
00:57:43.500 letting the mind at one end not scoring
00:57:45.900 at the other
00:57:47.099 but at least in this after giving it a
00:57:49.559 go
00:57:51.000 and it would have been so easy for their
00:57:52.800 heads to drop totally
00:57:55.559 Othello
00:58:00.660 surprising how Germany had been priced
00:58:03.780 open so easily as well
00:58:07.260 on at least three occasions
00:58:12.180 but their finishing has been more
00:58:13.800 ruthless
00:58:16.559 know yourself are is having an
00:58:18.240 unbelievably second half he's made four
00:58:20.760 saves already
00:58:21.510 [Applause]
00:58:24.599 everyone at Close Quarters
00:58:27.720 Muller down free kick against Luis
00:58:29.940 Gustavo
00:58:34.020 would be warned I think that his next
00:58:35.640 defense could produce a yellow card we
00:58:38.339 have had the amnesty of course no yellow
00:58:39.960 cards
00:58:41.940 in the quarterfinals
00:58:50.880 well here we have it paulinho
00:58:53.640 from today and it was directly at Neuer
00:58:56.099 and then the the tall German goalkeeper
00:58:59.220 got his fingers in the way of the second
00:59:01.260 effort
00:59:02.460 good goalkeeping
00:59:05.579 from the man from Bayern Munich who's
00:59:07.920 conceded three and kept three clean
00:59:09.660 sheets so far today maybe number four a
00:59:12.540 man by the way one half a million pounds
00:59:14.520 for charity on Who Wants To Be A
00:59:16.740 Millionaire in Germany
00:59:18.839 well
00:59:19.880 scalari would do anything
00:59:22.619 so there's the goal alone a million
00:59:27.420 touched out to Marcelo he's got chance
00:59:29.520 to make ground here Germany funnel back
00:59:32.040 Marcelo continues forward not a bad
00:59:34.740 looking Ball but slightly just too much
00:59:37.020 elevation and Pace on it for Oscar
00:59:43.799 must be so difficult for these
00:59:45.240 Brazilians knowing the contest is over
00:59:49.500 and they're not going to be making the
00:59:50.819 right headlines in
00:59:52.559 the newspapers or on Global TV tonight
01:00:00.680 now the nation has been truly gripped by
01:00:03.540 this world cup
01:00:05.760 which continues to produce plenty of
01:00:07.740 goals by the way we've now surpassed the
01:00:09.960 tally from Korea and Japan in 2002.
01:00:21.839 we're on to 164 goals in these finals
01:00:25.619 Korea Japan had 161 and the only World
01:00:29.880 Cup that produced more goals than this
01:00:31.619 one was France 1998
01:00:33.980 171. so we're seven adrift of that
01:00:37.619 Target
01:00:42.059 still with three games to go after this
01:00:44.339 one
01:00:45.180 still time to add of course in this half
01:00:47.160 the first German raid in this half led
01:00:49.920 by Muller
01:00:51.240 I think that might have gone dead no it
01:00:53.400 did not but uh Gabby Louise breasts the
01:00:56.579 ball back
01:00:57.400 [Applause]
01:01:02.400 sell has seen plenty of the ball in this
01:01:04.200 half
01:01:05.819 Neuer acting as sweeper now and taken
01:01:08.640 down rather unceremoniously by Ramirez
01:01:14.760 the referee is keeping his yellow cards
01:01:16.799 in his pocket at the moment
01:01:32.880 by Schweinsteiger
01:01:36.140 who's a half brother he's of course
01:01:38.280 Kevin Prince boatengu was playing in
01:01:40.740 these World Cup finals for Garner until
01:01:42.900 he was sent home Andre Sherlock will be
01:01:46.020 a substitute for Germany now probably
01:01:50.760 indeed that is the case
01:01:53.520 surely for closer who'll get a good hand
01:01:56.160 as he goes off I'm sure he's
01:01:58.380 he's broken the record the high scorer
01:02:01.020 in World Cup history he's overtaken
01:02:03.359 Ronaldo
01:02:05.280 with his 16th goal the polish-born
01:02:07.680 striker mirror slap closer and this is
01:02:10.440 his golden moment he thought he'd been
01:02:12.599 denied by Julio Cesar but given a second
01:02:15.540 invitation he stabbed it home
01:02:26.460 World Cup finals goal to his name
01:02:29.400 from the victory over Algeria
01:02:32.460 [Music]
01:02:37.400 the first thing Shirley does is take his
01:02:40.200 man Marcelo down and out of the action
01:02:42.180 free kick
01:02:48.540 Brazil looking for one scrap of
01:02:50.940 consolation the goal just one goal will
01:02:55.319 come from this that will be neuer's ball
01:03:03.359 closest britner record the attendance
01:03:05.339 here has broken a record as well because
01:03:07.280 the total attendances for Brazil 2014
01:03:10.619 have now gone beyond those in South
01:03:13.079 Africa four years ago
01:03:15.240 doesn't quite get through second one
01:03:17.579 does
01:03:18.599 Fred foyed by Neuer again
01:03:21.660 well Noyes made more saves in the second
01:03:23.700 half than he ever looked like having to
01:03:25.799 make in the first
01:03:29.040 Brazil have managed to conjure up a lot
01:03:31.260 of chances in this half and now he's
01:03:32.819 played in Here Sherlock I think thought
01:03:35.160 he was offside so he stopped running
01:03:40.619 I hesitate to say this but it's almost
01:03:42.480 as though Germany do not want to rub
01:03:44.640 Brazil's noses in it anymore
01:03:47.220 oh and then the ball is given away for
01:03:49.799 Muller Muller around the goalkeeper
01:03:52.140 because Julius is after the rescue
01:03:54.420 should have been six
01:03:57.480 understandable but it's almost as though
01:03:59.460 Germany have lost the will to score
01:04:01.200 goals at the moment
01:04:04.500 Muller had a real opportunity there
01:04:07.140 for his second of the day and remember
01:04:09.240 he's already got one hat-trick in these
01:04:10.920 finals
01:04:13.020 it's a strange second half because of
01:04:16.200 the scenario
01:04:20.460 goal scoring was made to look simple in
01:04:22.740 the first half by the European nation
01:04:30.850 [Applause]
01:04:34.079 mullet another chance for him tipped
01:04:36.599 over fine stop Julio Cesar well Muller
01:04:40.799 really meant that one
01:04:43.079 no doubt about that he's got his
01:04:44.760 appetite back
01:04:47.220 but that's as good a save as we've seen
01:04:53.579 Julius is out playing his football in
01:04:55.559 Toronto these days having lost his spot
01:04:58.380 at Queen spark Rangers in England
01:05:02.420 an hour gone Brazil nil Germany five
01:05:05.280 still
01:05:06.220 [Applause]
01:05:14.720 willing to put the effort in
01:05:18.660 Oscar
01:05:21.420 sadly won't be winning in Oscar today
01:05:23.940 David Louise
01:05:28.079 trying hard
01:05:31.859 from this part of the world
01:05:34.319 Gabby Louise
01:05:36.180 angles it through mic on
01:05:39.380 and again a big Collective role for a
01:05:43.079 penalty kick
01:05:45.720 why are the Germans surrounding the
01:05:47.579 Mexican referee
01:05:56.280 under win a penalty by a dive
01:06:00.020 boating's challenge
01:06:03.000 a Brazilian corner
01:06:07.319 will reach Bernard who will launch it
01:06:09.540 back in the man in green as it's
01:06:12.839 the Manning greens had everything this
01:06:14.640 half
01:06:21.660 into the Manning gray and there must be
01:06:23.460 some very gray faces around in Brazil at
01:06:25.559 the moment as well some white
01:06:29.039 and the scoreline enough to turn
01:06:30.599 people's hair white
01:06:32.460 Luis Gonzalez
01:06:36.839 Oscar wide
01:06:40.079 the ball in does not go beyond murtasaka
01:06:46.440 well a job well done for mirislav closer
01:06:48.839 for Ronaldo though the man whose record
01:06:51.200 he has overtaken
01:06:53.760 nothing but sadness I'm sure
01:06:55.859 Ronaldo working for television here in
01:06:58.980 Brazil
01:07:00.480 he scored both goals that beat Germany
01:07:02.700 in 2002 in the final in Yokohama but
01:07:05.819 nobody in yellow has managed to go away
01:07:07.440 as yet today
01:07:13.319 Bernard won't get onto this one
01:07:20.880 just meeting between these teams in
01:07:22.559 Brazil since 1992 when Brazil won 3-1
01:07:28.799 Brazil are not used to not scoring a
01:07:30.780 goal
01:07:32.059 paulinho now
01:07:33.920 just a final touch too heavy
01:07:47.760 long again for Bernard it's worth the
01:07:50.099 chase will he get to it he will hooks it
01:07:52.799 through the area but only as far as
01:07:55.020 hervedus
01:08:09.359 now it's David Luiz
01:08:11.579 Brazil trying to find some rhythm
01:08:17.819 they must be told
01:08:19.679 as to what went wrong in that first half
01:08:23.819 once again David Luiz trying to play as
01:08:25.738 a supplementary attacker now
01:08:28.738 but they can leave themselves exposed
01:08:31.380 Germany look to break here through the
01:08:33.540 center with cross two forward and they
01:08:36.839 are exposed it might just not get to the
01:08:40.020 man coming in surely because Julius
01:08:41.698 Caesar reaches for the ball
01:08:46.799 love may well be achieving his Destiny
01:08:49.439 here
01:08:55.560 Square for paulinho
01:08:57.920 denied by hooverness
01:09:08.580 foreign
01:09:16.859 of the referee he was the only one that
01:09:19.140 matters
01:09:21.960 the only time Brazil have failed to
01:09:23.460 score in these finals was in the goal
01:09:25.500 Australia with Mexico
01:09:26.529 [Applause]
01:09:37.380 well plenty forward here in yellow five
01:09:39.359 nil is that score line as it was and
01:09:41.759 seems to have been for a long time now
01:09:43.380 since the 29th minute actually
01:09:46.799 so Brazil have not conceded for 36
01:09:50.040 minutes
01:09:52.859 a very strange thing to be saying Luis
01:09:55.199 Gustavo
01:09:56.880 Dante that must be rot his appearance
01:10:00.480 his first appearance coinciding with
01:10:03.060 this concession of five goals
01:10:07.440 Fred
01:10:08.760 to their credit
01:10:10.260 Brazil are still battling but again Fred
01:10:12.600 is being booed by the Brazilian fans
01:10:14.820 Ramirez
01:10:18.420 looking for a in the German armor
01:10:21.360 Luis Gustavo
01:10:23.340 Germany content to sit back only one
01:10:25.679 player up in front of the ball that is
01:10:27.480 Thomas Muller
01:10:29.280 who's taken over from closer as the main
01:10:31.440 Striker now
01:10:33.300 still Davy Louise
01:10:35.699 can't get a meaningful touch on the ball
01:10:39.780 well if this one goes through the middle
01:10:41.340 Brazilian Dire Straits Schweinsteiger
01:10:44.159 allowed it to run through Julius Cesar
01:10:46.980 to the rescue for the umpteenth time in
01:10:48.960 this half when Germany have broken
01:10:52.679 maybe we're going to have a goal as half
01:10:56.100 stir all the Thrills and Spills in the
01:10:58.020 first 45 minutes Paulino good looking
01:11:00.719 ball here taken down by Bernard
01:11:04.199 several in the yellow await overhead
01:11:06.960 cake wide just not happening for Brazil
01:11:10.080 I'm afraid offside anyway
01:11:15.840 side awarded by the referee's assistant
01:11:17.900 Marcos Quintero from Mexico
01:11:23.760 it all looked very good until the Final
01:11:25.440 Touch
01:11:28.800 thank you
01:11:33.239 well Julio Cesar has prevented a goal on
01:11:36.300 at least three occasions when one seemed
01:11:38.159 a certainty in this half
01:11:39.960 but Germany a 23 minutes away from
01:11:42.659 moving forward into the final
01:11:47.760 first final since 2002.
01:11:59.760 nobody has played in more finals
01:12:03.420 than Germany
01:12:05.900 Brazil are going to make their third
01:12:07.739 switch Willian
01:12:10.860 what a great time to come on when your
01:12:12.480 side's losing five nil though surely the
01:12:14.699 whistle's already sounded free kick for
01:12:16.440 Germany and a yellow card shown for the
01:12:18.900 first time in this game to Dante to
01:12:21.780 complete his day
01:12:25.920 Dante there
01:12:27.480 the one number 13 on the other and one
01:12:30.000 was unlucky that one Dante
01:12:34.440 first booking of the match
01:12:42.960 now Brazil have lost only one of their
01:12:44.760 last 26 International matches they were
01:12:47.219 beaten in a friendly in Switzerland last
01:12:49.159 August almost a year ago
01:12:51.840 so what a day to choose for their next
01:12:54.060 defeat
01:12:56.340 and they have to defend once again lamb
01:13:00.659 wide is khadira
01:13:02.699 back into lamb Square six nil it is
01:13:07.340 Muller and there hardly anybody is
01:13:10.320 celebrating
01:13:12.239 and I think some Brazilians will be
01:13:14.460 leaving estadio mineral now because this
01:13:17.940 equals the heaviest defeat in Brazilian
01:13:20.340 history
01:13:21.659 going back to 1920 when they lost six
01:13:24.600 nil to Uruguay and the resounding booze
01:13:28.020 around the stadium are for for not only
01:13:31.140 the concession of the goal which was so
01:13:33.360 easy for Muller to dispatch
01:13:36.360 this made it six nil it's Muller's
01:13:38.699 second of the day it's his sixth of
01:13:41.580 these World Cup finals and his 11th in
01:13:45.179 the last two
01:13:47.760 Shirley it is with the goal
01:13:50.659 my apologies surely it was who stroked
01:13:54.780 it in
01:13:55.820 six nil we're all getting carried away
01:13:59.040 here Fred was taken off to resounding
01:14:02.280 booze to be replaced by William
01:14:14.760 this is a devastating day for Brazilian
01:14:18.420 football perhaps even more devastating
01:14:21.120 than the one in 1950 when they lost a
01:14:24.239 Uruguay
01:14:28.860 Andre Sherlock with his second World Cup
01:14:32.280 goal and his 15th at International level
01:14:37.500 say rounds off a complete day of utter
01:14:39.960 misery for Brazil because there are
01:14:41.760 still 20 minutes to go they might have a
01:14:44.040 goal of their own here they may not as
01:14:46.440 well Sheila leading a breakout and who
01:14:49.500 knows what the scoreline May finish as
01:14:52.100 you really feel for Brazil now
01:15:05.480 once again Germany have found the
01:15:08.159 appetite for more goals
01:15:16.440 well there is a disconsolate man he
01:15:18.600 really was booed to the rafters when he
01:15:21.179 came off
01:15:24.719 a man who's upset the Brazilian public
01:15:26.580 more than anybody else this is hit long
01:15:28.860 by David Luiz
01:15:30.659 this little fella here Bernard has kept
01:15:33.360 going
01:15:36.600 William
01:15:38.520 is there one moment of joy for Brazil
01:15:41.460 not from this effort
01:15:43.910 [Applause]
01:15:48.179 thank you
01:15:55.199 well I'm not quite sure what that look
01:15:57.239 means from scholari that was the last
01:16:00.060 animation we saw of Fred Louis Gustavo
01:16:03.380 and just everybody in the the yellow
01:16:06.900 persuasion today is heartbroken
01:16:13.560 totally unpredictable day in a World Cup
01:16:17.219 semi-final
01:16:20.920 [Applause]
01:16:36.960 now I do believe I do see some people in
01:16:39.600 yellow shirts leaving the stadium
01:16:46.140 home home to the sanctuary and quietness
01:16:49.020 of
01:16:50.159 from our homes where they just want to
01:16:52.020 forget about this day which promised so
01:16:54.060 much
01:16:55.500 [Applause]
01:17:02.640 picking out the men again here Germany
01:17:05.760 almost at will Brazil backtrack
01:17:10.380 this time no harm done the ball allowed
01:17:12.480 to run dead by Mike on
01:17:21.840 well it would be interesting to hear
01:17:23.460 what he has to say at the press
01:17:24.600 conference after the game
01:17:29.580 and no wonder they're smiling on the
01:17:31.260 German bench down there
01:17:37.679 William
01:17:40.380 five Brazilians forward here
01:17:42.719 and need to get one of these moves right
01:17:44.520 just to take some Solace from a horrid
01:17:48.060 day
01:17:51.540 short into the area
01:17:53.820 plenty of yellow shirts around almost
01:17:56.880 too many of anything and Neuer is equal
01:17:59.640 to the Final Shots
01:18:01.199 foreign
01:18:26.420 started the party remember in the 11th
01:18:28.980 minute and the goals going thick and
01:18:30.780 fast in that first half a couple from
01:18:33.360 Tony Cross one from Miroslav closer one
01:18:37.460 from Sammy kadira and now the 69th
01:18:40.920 minute effort from Andres Charlotte
01:18:43.280 completing total humiliation for Brazil
01:18:46.320 in their own country
01:18:52.560 Brazil
01:18:54.360 by alarm
01:19:02.760 we'll be onto this one again
01:19:05.940 a lot of red and black shirts around
01:19:08.340 here in the Brazilian half as they probe
01:19:10.860 and look for one more opening
01:19:18.960 then uh the one player who really does
01:19:20.699 seem to manage to keep going in this
01:19:22.320 half
01:19:28.800 it would only be a derisary cheer I
01:19:31.020 think if Brazil did manage to put one
01:19:32.699 goal on that score chart
01:19:35.219 15 minutes remaining
01:19:37.380 this ball too long
01:19:45.960 I was going to be a first World Cup
01:19:47.280 finals appearance here for a young man
01:19:50.280 Draxler from schalke 20 year old Julian
01:19:53.760 Draxler who's had a no taste of World
01:19:56.460 Cup football in these finals as yet
01:20:00.900 what an amazing moment for you to come
01:20:03.360 on in a World Cup semi-final with your
01:20:05.340 team's six goals to the good
01:20:10.500 Schweinsteiger I think he'll be replaced
01:20:13.380 with the biggest grin in town
01:20:15.250 [Applause]
01:20:18.480 it's going to be khadira not
01:20:19.739 Schweinsteiger
01:20:21.340 [Applause]
01:20:23.460 kadira had been a slight doubt before
01:20:25.320 the game he picked up a knock in the
01:20:26.820 last match
01:20:27.900 scores just withdrawal that he gives
01:20:29.400 away for Draxler for the closing quarter
01:20:32.219 of an hour
01:20:33.540 scored a goal today Sammy kadira
01:20:36.900 I wonder if young Draxler can get one
01:20:40.620 fancy almost anybody in a German shirt
01:20:42.719 to score now
01:20:45.060 for Brazil then William
01:20:49.500 Luis Gustavo
01:20:55.220 [Music]
01:20:57.300 parlance Germany might well declare but
01:20:59.699 on the other hand they might be totally
01:21:01.260 ruthless and go for as many as they can
01:21:03.000 possibly get it's a bit of a kick out
01:21:04.500 here
01:21:06.659 and mullet and David Louise are not on
01:21:09.239 the best of terms at the moment
01:21:14.400 hang on
01:21:20.400 the Muller is not best pleased certainly
01:21:24.420 Luis on the ball I fall through it's a
01:21:27.780 fresh air shot and golfing terms
01:21:31.219 mullet turning his back I think David
01:21:33.300 Luiz thought he stamped on his foot
01:21:35.760 and it's all led to a little bit of
01:21:37.500 nastiness and a bit of play acting
01:21:43.260 at the end of the day
01:21:44.820 Sanyo Rodriguez took no action
01:21:49.620 Brazil nil Germany six with 13 minutes
01:21:53.040 to go
01:22:12.600 foreign
01:22:24.780 left out of the starting lineup again
01:22:26.640 today with the portang in
01:22:29.219 center-back alongside Hummels and then
01:22:31.140 Hummel's taken off at half time
01:22:36.739 now playing in the left ball back
01:22:39.239 position
01:22:40.250 [Applause]
01:22:42.360 space opening up again but this time
01:22:44.340 it's spotted by David Luiz
01:22:53.580 so they might have number seven here now
01:22:55.620 they have got seven eight
01:22:58.320 hammered in an absolutely terrific
01:23:00.840 strike from Charlotte who has his second
01:23:03.239 in a matter of minutes and this
01:23:05.940 embarrassment for Brazil is more acute
01:23:08.940 by the minute
01:23:11.219 it was an acute angle he loves the
01:23:13.380 Finish it's a rasping one
01:23:15.360 but the Brazilians just want to go back
01:23:18.480 to the dressing rooms if the Earth could
01:23:20.640 come up and swallow them they'd be happy
01:23:22.560 at the moment never ever have they seen
01:23:24.719 a day like this it is now a record
01:23:27.480 defeat for Brazil
01:23:30.620 Julio Cesar has had to pick the ball out
01:23:33.540 of his net seven times Sherlock lashed
01:23:37.140 it in off the underside of the bar
01:23:39.540 and it leads to the most extraordinary
01:23:42.480 scoreline I think in World Cup history I
01:23:44.940 think it's fair to say this 79 minutes
01:23:47.940 played in Bello Horizonte and a
01:23:50.940 scoreline
01:23:52.340 Brazil nil Germany seven
01:23:57.679 you heard it right
01:24:00.080 but for Brazil it's all gone wrong
01:24:04.560 to those for sure today three in these
01:24:07.260 finals
01:24:10.020 here are Brazil with an attack
01:24:14.460 Bernard
01:24:17.219 oh Ramirez gets it all knotted up in his
01:24:19.739 feet now
01:24:26.100 well surely got a hat trick recently
01:24:28.140 against Sweden and the qualifying type
01:24:30.540 he's on a hat-trick again now
01:24:33.360 Ramirez for Brazil
01:24:36.120 who are being roundly booed by all the
01:24:38.760 supporters in the stadium and there are
01:24:40.440 58 141 of them
01:24:44.219 and apart from the Germans in that crowd
01:24:46.620 I'm afraid the the rest are very very
01:24:49.560 unhappy even if they score now it won't
01:24:52.140 mean anything they might score Marcelo
01:24:55.260 wide
01:24:59.179 oh do they want to hear that final
01:25:01.860 whistle that they've got 10 minutes at
01:25:03.780 least to wait for it
01:25:05.640 now is it that's it that's the scoreline
01:25:08.219 of this world cup or any World Cup
01:25:12.300  around the world
01:25:13.740 [Applause]
01:25:15.000 in time
01:25:18.520 [Applause]
01:25:23.520 Neuer
01:25:25.140 the funny thing is the first 15 minutes
01:25:27.120 of the second half Brazil might have
01:25:28.739 scored two or three times but for Neuer
01:25:34.800 foreign
01:25:41.420 say to the public after this
01:26:03.010 [Applause]
01:26:10.139 for mullet
01:26:13.400 [Applause]
01:26:14.780 was chanting ill lays for the German
01:26:17.100 passing
01:26:19.800 alarm a second time in the move there
01:26:22.020 are three in red and black across the
01:26:23.520 edge of the 18-yard zone urzil
01:26:27.600 short in here
01:26:30.679 Shirley's figured in the move twice
01:26:32.639 alarm a third time
01:26:35.280 training ground exercise now
01:26:37.679 for demand shaft
01:26:39.950 [Applause]
01:26:44.360 how many passes have they put together
01:26:46.500 here
01:26:47.360 [Applause]
01:26:57.300 this is extraordinary they're just
01:26:59.580 looking to get goal number eight and
01:27:02.100 cricketing parlance they've declared
01:27:14.159 well I'll be showing you the highlights
01:27:16.020 at the end of the game low lights so far
01:27:18.659 as Brazil is concerned
01:27:25.920 foreign
01:27:29.360 110 television stations covering this
01:27:32.280 match here in the stadium today and I'll
01:27:34.860 guarantee not one of them predicted this
01:27:37.139 scoreline
01:27:42.780 being globe globally to billions
01:27:49.940 and I'll be amazed if anybody had a bet
01:27:52.679 on this scoreline
01:27:54.840 another billionaire if they did
01:28:02.219 still they continue to
01:28:04.679 put the passage together still Brazil
01:28:07.020 Retreat still Brazil dreads it getting
01:28:09.120 to eight
01:28:10.380 scherler is in there trying to help
01:28:12.179 himself to another one
01:28:19.139 fastest
01:28:21.600 scene in World Cup history when Brazil
01:28:23.460 leave
01:28:27.120 Oscar
01:28:29.040 Bernard
01:28:34.580 [Applause]
01:28:40.980 and now it is Brazil who managed to
01:28:42.719 stroke the ball around as if to say well
01:28:44.639 we can still play football
01:28:48.659 say today has not been their day would
01:28:50.880 be the understatement of the year
01:28:53.580 Luis Gustavo to David Luiz who suddenly
01:28:56.699 turns up an outside left
01:28:59.520 well Brazil have been all over the place
01:29:01.320 all day Marcelo
01:29:04.340 Ramirez
01:29:06.000 goes for goal can't beat Neuer
01:29:10.560 shot Brazil have had plenty of those in
01:29:13.199 the second half hardly any in the first
01:29:22.199 and here they come again with Brazil
01:29:27.719 ER has enjoyed himself as substitutes
01:29:35.639 five minutes to go
01:29:39.000 five minutes of torture if you're a
01:29:41.340 Brazilian
01:29:42.800 five minutes of bliss if you're a German
01:29:48.890 [Music]
01:29:53.580 all too easy
01:30:00.310 [Applause]
01:30:01.739 steam went out of the match as early as
01:30:03.840 the 28th minute
01:30:13.520 Brazil's only response really came early
01:30:16.080 in the second half when they looked as
01:30:18.060 though at least they might get a goal
01:30:19.500 but I think even that is a full-on hope
01:30:21.719 for them now
01:30:25.739 it will be no battle
01:30:29.400 [Applause]
01:30:31.739 try this will go down on the CVS of
01:30:34.320 every one of these Brazilian players but
01:30:36.179 for Andre Shirley here he's just added
01:30:38.580 to his CV with a crunching second goal
01:30:42.540 second for him
01:30:46.080 seventh for Germany and the Brazilians
01:30:49.320 applauded the quality of Shirley's
01:30:51.480 strike
01:30:52.320 I'm afraid they've had nothing of
01:30:53.760 quality from their own players to
01:30:55.199 applaud all day
01:31:07.739 and the World Cup will be over for many
01:31:09.719 Brazilian people now
01:31:11.940 their team will have to go to the
01:31:14.280 capital Brasilia on Saturday to play in
01:31:16.440 the third fourth playoff match well
01:31:18.659 Germany will contest the World Cup final
01:31:20.580 of the maracanari in Rio on Sunday
01:31:29.760 three minutes remaining
01:31:36.840 oh and the Miss by Marcelo opens the
01:31:39.840 door for sure
01:31:41.820 Germany will probably get a corner from
01:31:43.920 this I will
01:31:49.260 he's putting his feet up there probably
01:31:51.659 could have put them up after half an
01:31:52.920 hour
01:31:57.000 Scolari was talking yesterday about the
01:31:59.340 hurt of losing to Germany on past
01:32:01.920 occasions as the Portuguese coach
01:32:07.260 not as the Brazilian coach he was the
01:32:09.239 World Cup winner in 2002 against this
01:32:11.760 same opposition talk about revenge
01:32:23.440 [Applause]
01:32:30.659 and the direction of featuring through
01:32:33.120 the Midfield is much talk about him
01:32:35.460 potentially going yeah
01:32:37.500 to another club
01:32:39.540 possibly Arsenal
01:32:41.699 shelter
01:32:43.080 these are the goalkeepers ball he's had
01:32:45.600 enough he's seen enough of it he's had
01:32:46.920 to pick it out of the net most of the
01:32:48.360 day
01:32:50.760 on goes Marcelo
01:32:52.620 company with williana
01:32:54.600 Williams through ball here is Oscars
01:32:56.940 he's on side
01:32:59.280 all the way through the area
01:33:04.199 afraid there's going to be nothing no
01:33:06.239 tangible reward for Brazil today last
01:33:09.000 little ball from Willian and his Chelsea
01:33:11.340 colleague Oscar there
01:33:13.080 meet Neuer couldn't find that out
01:33:18.020 and I think the referee has decided that
01:33:22.080 no additional time might be a very good
01:33:25.020 idea today
01:33:29.520 it will save further embarrassment and
01:33:31.739 humiliation for Brazil thank you
01:33:34.380 unless they can just find one goal from
01:33:36.659 Bernard no it's slashed Over the Bar
01:33:39.210 [Applause]
01:33:48.300 we are inside the last minute of the
01:33:50.280 most extraordinary 90 minutes we've had
01:33:52.260 here in the World Cup of
01:33:54.320 2014. Germany will have the last attack
01:33:57.060 of the day they might even get the
01:33:58.860 eighth goal of the day
01:34:01.440 should have been eight it really should
01:34:04.460 but met at nurse who can't apply the
01:34:08.040 coup de gras he doesn't need to do
01:34:11.820 the Brazilian throats were slit long ago
01:34:14.400 the metators who just failed to heat
01:34:17.400 further embarrassment on the host nation
01:34:21.840 Oscar maybe he can chip the keeper maybe
01:34:24.239 he can Force One in Oscar he's got a
01:34:27.179 goal It's Brazil won Germany seven and I
01:34:32.340 have never seen a goal less celebrated
01:34:34.560 in my life
01:34:35.380 [Applause]
01:34:39.300 the Brazilian supporters don't know what
01:34:41.639 to do they don't know whether to laugh
01:34:43.320 or to cry or to cheer or to groan to see
01:34:48.239 what they've been waiting for all day
01:34:50.639 Oscar into the center onto the center
01:34:53.460 spot actually and Manuel Neuer at last
01:34:55.920 is beaten by somebody in the canary
01:34:58.800 yellow shirt of our world cup hosts
01:35:01.739 Oscar's the name it makes the scoreline
01:35:04.679 even more astonishing Brazil won Germany
01:35:08.760 seven oh Julius Cesar maybe did
01:35:11.100 celebrate newly as furious at conceding
01:35:13.320 a goal in the 90th minute
01:35:16.440 and the referee decided then we would
01:35:19.320 have a couple of minutes in added time
01:35:24.659 huh
01:35:25.860 all very strange you might get another
01:35:27.719 one here Bernard he's on side Brazil
01:35:30.540 have two across in the center it's
01:35:33.060 pulled back in for Willian
01:35:37.980 another chance in Brazil
01:35:42.420 it's not in the Germans nature to let
01:35:44.159 them score again
01:35:47.219 but everybody's coming up by the
01:35:48.900 goalkeeper what an extraordinary
01:35:51.060 situation this is
01:35:54.300 gets through to Willian
01:35:59.460 David Louise well he scored from this
01:36:01.320 range in the last game
01:36:03.000 with a better shot than that one
01:36:07.560 well we were all hoping for an eight
01:36:09.300 goal final oh we might get a nine goal
01:36:12.060 one yet
01:36:14.460 safel
01:36:16.920 surely the referee is going to blow the
01:36:18.659 final whistle
01:36:28.739 crowned the estadio mineral in Bella
01:36:32.100 Horizonte the Brazilians sink to their
01:36:36.179 knees
01:36:36.590 [Applause]
01:36:38.960 the only word you can think of is total
01:36:41.820 disbelief right now
01:36:44.280 Scolari magnanimously goes to shake the
01:36:46.860 hands of the new World Cup record holder
01:36:48.960 Miroslav closer Manuel Neuer there
01:36:51.060 defied Brazil in the early minutes of
01:36:52.679 the second half by which time the game
01:36:55.080 had gone it was gone away from Brazil in
01:36:58.080 the opening half an hour with Muller and
01:37:00.179 closer and gross twice and kadira all on
01:37:02.699 the score sheets Shirley got his name on
01:37:05.100 it twice in the second half and Oscar
01:37:07.739 summoned up a response from Brazil in
01:37:11.699 the 90th minute scant's consolation on a
01:37:16.080 most extraordinary semi-final
01:37:18.960 Yogi Lewis side will play in the World
01:37:21.480 Cup Final in Rio on Sunday against
01:37:24.840 either the Netherlands or Argentina but
01:37:27.960 the final score here in Bello Horizonte
01:37:30.239 was Brazil won Germany seven
