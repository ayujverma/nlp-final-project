00:05:20.350 [Applause]
00:05:26.240 cristiano ronaldo has scored seven
00:05:29.759 penalties for portugal but he's scored
00:05:32.160 only three goals
00:05:33.759 in his previous 13 world cup finals
00:05:37.039 appearances
00:05:39.600 he's the only portuguese player to score
00:05:42.000 at three different world cups
00:05:45.199 can he be the only portuguese player to
00:05:47.039 score at four different world cups

00:06:02.319 any doubt
00:06:14.880 what a start for portugal
00:06:24.560 de gea goes one way
00:06:26.479 ronaldo goes the other
00:06:31.120 it's his 82nd goal for portugal
00:06:34.800 on his
00:06:35.880 151st appearance
00:06:39.600 it just had to be him
00:06:41.810 [Applause]
00:06:53.520 portugal could not have dreamt of a
00:06:56.240 better beginning
00:06:58.400 to their opening group b fixture
00:07:06.319 it's a nightmare start for fernando
00:07:09.039 hierro and spain

00:07:59.919 free kick portugal
00:08:07.440 challenged by busquets
00:08:19.599 cristiano ronaldo is the first player in
00:08:22.400 history to score at eight successive
00:08:25.360 major tournaments
00:08:27.919 he just keeps creating records
00:08:31.919 and you know he's only 33 years old
00:08:35.599 and given
00:08:36.719 his physical condition you really
00:08:38.399 wouldn't bet against him being in qatar
00:08:41.039 in four years time
00:08:43.279 provided portugal qualify to appear at a
00:08:46.080 fifth world cup finals
00:08:48.070 [Applause]
00:08:50.880 ramos
00:08:54.080 sergio ramos ended yesterday's
00:08:57.360 media conference
00:09:00.560 which was full of questions about the
00:09:02.080 managerial and coaching situation
00:09:05.040 with spain by saying cheer up we're not
00:09:07.200 at a funeral
00:09:08.800 let's get this world cup started
00:09:11.440 and with that he stood up and promptly
00:09:13.120 marched out of the room
00:09:14.560 he did say it with a smile on his face
00:09:16.160 it has to be said
00:09:19.600 but there'll be no smiles in the spain
00:09:22.320 camp at the moment
00:09:24.240 ronaldo clearly fouled you can see the
00:09:26.160 referee's position an absolutely
00:09:27.920 unimpeded view
00:09:32.320 and ronaldo does what
00:09:34.240 he does best
00:09:37.600 incidentally talking of him playing at a
00:09:39.519 fifth world cup finals in four years
00:09:41.200 time no player has actually scored
00:09:45.200 at five different world cup finals

00:10:08.720 played at three world cup finals
00:10:13.600 there was nobody better placed really
00:10:15.519 than the
00:10:17.200 sporting director of the spanish
00:10:19.519 football association
00:10:24.560 or the spanish football federation to
00:10:26.240 give it its correct idol

00:12:01.600 his international debut way back in 2006
00:12:04.320 david silva

00:12:09.360 world cup final victory

00:12:33.440 front
00:12:34.320 cristiano ronaldo with an early penalty
00:12:37.279 after he was fouled in the penalty area
00:12:42.320 baskets
00:12:44.240 it was in fact portugal's quickest world
00:12:46.320 cup goal
00:12:47.519 since
00:12:48.519 1966
00:12:50.480 when they reached the semi-finals with
00:12:52.480 the great eusabio and company only to be

00:13:31.680 you can hear the reaction from the
00:13:32.959 spanish supporters
00:13:36.800 as albert

00:13:43.920 rupert tricia made one appearance at the
00:13:46.480 last world cup before being injured

00:13:57.760 of four sporting players in the
00:14:00.079 portuguese squad who have this week
00:14:01.680 served notice on their club that they
00:14:03.839 wish to terminate their contract because
00:14:06.000 after a
00:14:07.279 rather unsavory incident at the club's
00:14:09.040 training ground

00:14:12.480 william

00:14:35.440 alba
00:14:37.519 we're going to take on pepe
00:14:40.399 isco
00:14:43.519 that's a corner
00:14:46.720 spain's first corner of the match
00:14:51.920 and they've taken it short
00:14:53.680 plenty of bodies forward in white for
00:14:55.440 spain
00:14:56.959 no way through for iniesta
00:14:59.480 [Applause]
00:15:07.890 [Applause]
00:15:15.740 [Applause]
00:15:17.120 costa
00:15:18.160 is the target
00:15:22.240 there's a little bit of debate as to
00:15:23.600 whether it would be
00:15:25.360 sergio costa playing up front or maybe
00:15:27.920 rodrigo the
00:15:29.920 other striker
00:15:32.000 diego costa has won the day
00:15:34.880 here's raphael guerrero

00:16:29.600 gathered by rui patricio
00:16:31.400 [Applause]
00:16:36.079 hierro is like a
00:16:37.600 boxer tricks on the edge of the
00:16:39.199 technical areas
00:16:41.120 constantly moving up and down urging his
00:16:43.120 players the newly installed
00:16:44.959 spanish national coach
00:16:57.920 this is raphael guerrero
00:17:01.260 [Applause]
00:17:09.439 just that little bit of pressure from
00:17:10.880 koster
00:17:12.160 meant the slight mis-kick from the
00:17:13.839 goalkeeper
00:17:16.559 kwedesh just beaten to it by koke
00:17:20.720 here's pk

00:18:11.600 silva wanted the ball played forward to
00:18:13.200 him
00:18:18.080 picked up on this at near side by nacho
00:18:22.080 away by ronaldo and portugal might be
00:18:24.240 able to break away here it's gonzalo
00:18:26.320 quaydash and ronaldo making the run on
00:18:28.320 this near side
00:18:29.919 kwadash will have to go all the way on
00:18:31.600 his own
00:18:34.160 the pass was on for a fraction of a
00:18:36.000 second there to ronaldo
00:18:38.320 but the portuguese captain had to check
00:18:40.160 his run for fear of going offside
00:18:48.240 you see gwedesh here just having a
00:18:49.840 little look to his left
00:18:51.430 [Applause]
00:18:54.000 and then rather run up a cul-de-sac

00:19:02.400 pk
00:19:08.130 [Applause]
00:19:22.320 referee was just waiting there to see
00:19:24.160 what might happen
00:19:29.919 and as moutinho challenged for it
00:19:34.080 then it was gwadesh who was caught
00:19:47.840 is the first player to be cautioned then
00:19:49.520 tonight
00:19:52.400 and spain
00:19:53.840 have some defending to do
00:19:56.799 it's a promising position this for
00:19:58.240 portugal and you know
00:20:00.320 who wants it as well
00:20:02.480 it's the familiar setup
00:20:05.830 [Applause]
00:20:08.559 will he go for goal will he drive it in
00:20:10.720 hoping to get a touch from a teammate
00:20:13.190 [Applause]
00:20:15.760 everyone knows what's coming
00:20:19.120 but portugal do have somebody else out
00:20:20.799 there just in case the free kick
00:20:23.280 comes in a different direction it is
00:20:25.039 ronaldo it's straight into the wall
00:20:43.760 look at the power behind this
00:20:46.240 two portuguese players though in the

00:21:22.640 ramos
00:21:24.960 caught by iniesta
00:21:39.679 isn't going to get on the end of that

00:28:10.320 of his shot
00:28:12.000 but goal line technology
00:28:14.640 would have alerted the referee to the
00:28:16.399 fact that
00:28:17.600 the ball had crossed the line
00:28:22.080 what an effort that was from isco

00:29:40.960 and initially it didn't appear as though
00:29:42.480 the assistant on this near side had
00:29:43.919 raised his flag
00:29:49.200 bruno fernandez

00:37:02.720 goal in spanish football history

00:41:56.480 a few minutes
00:42:01.200 font
00:42:06.960 got a touch on the way through
00:42:08.240 portuguese throw
00:42:11.599 we've got two balls
00:42:13.119 in play at the moment which is why one
00:42:14.800 of them is going to have to be
00:42:16.560 kicked off the pitch
00:42:17.700 [Applause]
00:42:26.800 you do wonder who will be the happier of
00:42:28.880 these two teams if it stays this way at
00:42:31.280 half time
00:42:35.119 will it be
00:42:36.160 fernando
00:42:37.359 or fernando santos
00:42:41.359 santos to be honest never really looks
00:42:43.119 very happy does he but
00:42:44.800 he did crack a smile during the media
00:42:46.880 conference yesterday on one or two
00:42:48.240 occasions although portugal
00:42:51.599 who fielded
00:42:53.119 joao moutinho and fernando santos to the
00:42:55.359 world's media yesterday were a little
00:42:58.880 aggrieved shall we say that most of the
00:43:00.800 questions were all about the spanish
00:43:02.880 coaching position
00:43:04.480 and the chaos in the spanish camp ahead
00:43:07.040 of this fixture
00:43:11.599 but it has to be said with so much
00:43:13.040 experience in the spanish lineup that
00:43:16.960 this team can
00:43:19.200 almost manage itself
00:43:22.560 referee thought about an advantage there
00:43:24.400 decided against it
00:43:26.900 [Music]
00:43:29.680 foul on costa
00:43:31.119 after the early challenge on busquets
00:43:38.240 okay just ensuring that he doesn't get a
00:43:39.920 yellow card
00:43:42.400 for that challenge
00:43:47.130 [Applause]
00:44:06.000 spain very much stretched right across
00:44:07.760 the full width of this pitch at the
00:44:09.119 moment
00:44:16.000 cook it
00:44:16.450 [Applause]

00:44:39.599 signing when he took over at real madrid
00:44:41.599 back in 2013.
00:44:48.000 iniesta

00:44:57.200 in his defense
00:45:00.160 there were spanish strikers
00:45:02.400 looming behind guerrero
00:45:04.900 [Applause]
00:45:07.680 it's a fourth corner then for spain
00:45:12.190 [Applause]
00:45:14.160 towards pk gathered by rui patricio
00:45:17.200 and the quick throw as well here's
00:45:18.640 cristiano ronaldo
00:45:21.440 portugal looking to break again
00:45:25.119 they've not been successful on the two
00:45:26.720 previous occasions and
00:45:28.400 spain now have men back in numbers
00:45:33.040 william

00:46:19.599 second goal of the night his second goal
00:46:22.160 of the night and very much against the
00:46:24.319 run of play portugal are back in front
00:46:35.230 [Applause]
00:46:38.480 there's the ball forward
00:46:40.800 great ash able to take it down
00:46:44.720 and ronaldo's shot
00:46:46.560 should have been comfortable for david
00:46:48.560 de gea
00:46:51.760 what an error
00:46:59.359 one
00:47:00.319 that will haunt david de gea for years
00:47:03.119 to come
00:47:07.200 because just before half time cristiano
00:47:09.920 ronaldo has turned this group match back
00:47:12.560 in portugal's favour
00:47:24.240 22 goals
00:47:26.240 in his last 18 internationals for
00:47:28.160 cristiano ronaldo and portugal of course
00:47:31.200 scored twice
00:47:32.559 against a spanish side who conceded just
00:47:35.520 three goals
00:47:37.119 in their 10 qualifying matches
00:47:40.640 as we go into an additional minimum of
00:47:43.680 one minute
00:47:46.800 i don't know about you i don't
00:47:48.319 particularly want half time to come
00:47:54.800 it has been fantastic fair
00:48:00.240 silver
00:48:00.800 [Applause]
00:48:04.400 ramos
00:48:09.599 alba
00:48:10.800 looking to take on cedric
00:48:12.720 spain get another corner
00:48:15.599 and this may well be the last
00:48:18.079 passage of play in the first half as you
00:48:20.160 can see we are almost
00:48:22.880 at the additional one minute stage
00:48:25.760 corner taken quickly
00:48:27.920 referees had a good look at his watch
00:48:30.640 what a first half that was in
00:48:32.839 sochi cristiano ronaldo putting portugal
00:48:36.559 in front with an early penalty and then
00:48:38.240 in front again with a late goal that oh
00:48:40.800 much to an error from david de gea
00:48:43.920 diego costa
00:48:45.599 with the goal for spain
00:48:48.319 it's been absorbing
00:48:50.240 it's been wonderful
00:48:52.079 it's been engrossing
00:48:53.839 and it has been a fantastic first 45
00:48:56.800 minutes
00:49:00.400 at the break it is portugal two spain
00:49:03.680 one
00:49:07.330 [Music]
00:49:11.380 [Applause]
00:49:18.480 no changes to either team in terms of
00:49:20.640 personnel as portugal get the second
00:49:23.520 half started here in sochi leading by
00:49:26.720 two goals to one portugal will be hoping
00:49:30.079 fervently there is
00:49:32.000 no change in the scoreline in safaris
00:49:35.200 they have to be leading at the end of
00:49:37.200 the 90 minutes 2-1 they lead at the
00:49:38.800 moment cristiano ronaldo with both goals
00:49:41.839 an early penalty
00:49:43.760 and then a late strike
00:49:46.240 which somehow eluded david de gea in the
00:49:48.960 spanish goal
00:49:50.060 [Applause]
00:49:52.960 diego costa
00:49:54.640 with the goal for spanish
00:49:57.200 side
00:49:59.440 cristiano ronaldo who has a hat-trick
00:50:01.200 has a real habit of scoring hat-tricks
00:50:04.160 if he were to score again tonight it
00:50:06.079 would be his 51st career hat-trick which
00:50:09.359 is
00:50:10.240 simply remarkable isn't it
00:50:12.559 what more can you say about
00:50:15.280 one of the world's greatest ever players
00:50:19.520 and let's face it the
00:50:21.680 debate
00:50:23.760 as to whether leonel messi or cristiano
00:50:26.319 ronaldo is the better
00:50:28.480 is it a little irrelevant let's just
00:50:29.920 enjoy the fact that we have two supreme
00:50:32.720 world talents gracing the world stage at
00:50:35.599 the same time
00:50:37.440 it would also be the 51st world cup
00:50:39.280 finals hat trick if he were to score
00:50:41.520 again
00:50:43.680 spain
00:50:45.359 determined to find a way back into this
00:50:47.680 match and they certainly had
00:50:49.359 very productive spells in the first half
00:50:56.800 either side of the gulp
00:50:59.520 from diego costa
00:51:01.920 spain in white if you have just joined
00:51:03.760 us portugal in the all red
00:51:10.000 well he looked offside and eventually
00:51:11.599 the flag was raised
00:51:26.559 coming into this world cup portugal had
00:51:28.240 lost just one of their last 18 matches
00:51:30.319 that was to the netherlands
00:51:32.319 who aren't here in russia this summer in
00:51:34.480 a friendly in march otherwise 12 wins
00:51:37.119 and five draws
00:51:42.559 that's for spain unbeaten under their
00:51:44.640 former coach
00:51:45.839 lopez

00:53:49.760 silva trying to get away from william
00:53:52.480 costa

00:55:58.070 [Applause]
00:55:59.680 not quite the same tempo at the
00:56:01.839 beginning of this second half as there
00:56:04.559 was through the majority of the first
00:56:23.950 [Applause]
00:56:25.760 alba's little touch back
00:56:28.160 no way through for iniesta tied it up by

00:57:42.160 semi-final shootout defeat to spain at
00:57:44.400 the 2012 european championship finals
00:57:52.319 is this too far out for a
00:57:54.559 shot on goal
00:58:05.040 silver on the rider
00:58:07.680 he's behind the ball cocaine standing in

00:59:20.220 [Applause]
00:59:20.920 [Music]
00:59:25.359 and that in all honesty was the first
00:59:27.040 meaningful action of this second half

00:59:39.359 eight goals in his last eight starts
00:59:42.559 for spain
00:59:44.000 no wonder they're delighted

01:00:15.040 was fouled
01:00:16.800 [Applause]
01:00:22.000 i'll tell you he'll be the most relieved
01:00:23.520 man inside the stadium here in sochi
01:00:25.599 with that equalizer and that'll be david
01:00:27.280 de gea the
01:00:29.200 spanish goalkeeper
01:00:30.920 [Applause]
01:00:37.680 his error
01:00:39.839 now
01:00:40.960 in the great big scheme of things

01:00:44.319 level at two apiece

01:01:36.799 persistence from spain
01:01:39.440 now it might drop for the shot here oh
01:01:41.760 what a shot that is
01:01:45.040 nacho the man who gave away the penalty
01:01:48.160 early on in this match
01:01:51.040 has
01:01:53.119 redeemed himself in style
01:02:06.160 they didn't look to be a way through
01:02:07.599 here for spain
01:02:11.039 but the trio of spanish players
01:02:13.920 somehow worked it through
01:02:15.839 it set up really nicely for the fullback
01:02:19.599 look at nachos eyes
01:02:21.680 concentrating fully
01:02:26.319 it's a lovely strike
01:02:28.720 curling bending in off the post
01:02:33.520 wow

01:02:52.810 [Music]
01:02:58.559 we have still to reach the hour mark
01:03:02.079 this has the potential to be
01:03:05.200 a game to be remembered for years to
01:03:07.119 come now ronaldo wants a yellow card for
01:03:09.760 the challenge on him
01:03:16.000 are some officials who may well have
01:03:17.520 been tempted to book the portuguese
01:03:19.520 captain for his reaction
01:03:21.760 as he went down there
01:03:23.680 [Applause]
01:03:36.880 man
01:03:44.400 portugal behind for the first time this
01:03:46.880 evening

01:03:55.280 this is bruno fernandes
01:03:59.350 [Applause]
01:04:08.319 here's nacho strike again
01:04:12.720 his first goal for his country
01:04:22.240 he's actually an inspiration
01:04:24.160 nacho he's had diabetes since he was a
01:04:26.640 child and was told age 12 that he should
01:04:29.440 give up football
01:04:31.200 a second opinion
01:04:34.000 said otherwise
01:04:35.920 he always carries his
01:04:38.160 insulin kit with him and his proof that
01:04:41.320 [Applause]
01:04:43.599 diabetes is not necessarily a barrier to
01:04:46.400 reaching the very top levels of
01:04:48.880 international sport
01:04:52.700 [Applause]
01:04:59.039 ronaldo
01:05:00.480 couldn't get hold of it
01:05:02.400 straight out of play by pk
01:05:11.480 [Applause]
01:05:13.520 cedric will take the throw
01:05:16.400 the fullback who plays in the english

01:05:25.980 [Applause]
01:05:30.799 cedric's reaction
01:05:34.240 was not
01:05:35.280 approved of by the referee
01:05:39.280 portuguese defender rather felt that
01:05:40.880 isco went down a little easily there
01:05:43.760 ramos
01:05:46.160 here's pk
01:05:50.160 oh he picked up by ronaldo
01:05:53.520 driven into the middle towards great ash

01:06:20.799 everybody back for spain virtually
01:06:22.799 everybody forward for portugal
01:06:25.119 towards gwadash

01:06:54.400 but a free kick nonetheless
01:07:03.839 spain have won their opening match just
01:07:05.760 twice in their last 12 world cups three
01:07:09.200 draws and
01:07:10.559 seven defeats
01:07:14.079 one of those defeats came in 2010
01:07:17.680 when they lost
01:07:19.280 their opening match to switzerland by
01:07:22.000 one goal to nil but they then became the
01:07:24.079 first team to win the world cup despite
01:07:27.200 losing their opening fixture of the
01:07:28.960 tournament
01:07:32.350 [Applause]
01:07:36.720 these two teams most definitely the
01:07:38.079 favorites to make it through from group
01:07:40.160 b
01:07:41.200 morocco and iran
01:07:43.440 the other two nations in the group

01:08:38.399 going to come off
01:08:42.319 i have no inside knowledge other than
01:08:43.839 the fact that the referee's board is
01:08:45.040 already showing the fourth officials
01:08:46.560 board rather is already showing the
01:08:48.479 numbers 16 and 10 on it

01:10:27.760 [Music]
01:10:31.840 pepe
01:10:35.679 and still portugal waits to make the
01:10:37.520 change
01:10:45.199 pepe
01:10:47.760 taken down by ronaldo no way past nacho
01:10:52.400 his real madrid teammate
01:10:55.520 here's
01:10:56.840 william moutinho
01:11:02.800 silva
01:11:05.600 william works it wide
01:11:08.560 guerrero
01:11:10.880 william
01:11:12.640 towards cedric
01:11:15.360 and now the change presumably will be
01:11:17.040 made
01:11:17.920 and it is bruno fernandez who is coming
01:11:20.080 off for portugal
01:11:24.740 [Music]
01:11:32.239 who
01:11:32.960 is with into milan in italy but spent
01:11:34.719 the second half of last season on loan
01:11:36.960 at west ham in the english premier
01:11:38.560 league
01:11:40.440 [Music]
01:11:51.430 [Applause]
01:11:58.719 it is very much a positional change for
01:12:01.360 portugal as we see that
01:12:03.199 spain are going to bring on
01:12:04.880 tiago
01:12:08.400 but it may well have been influenced by
01:12:09.760 the fact that bruno fernandez was the
01:12:11.520 only portuguese player to have been
01:12:13.520 cautioned in this match so far
01:12:22.000 cedric
01:12:26.560 teasing ball away by pk
01:12:29.440 busquets
01:12:32.000 isco
01:12:33.760 really stretching to bring that ball
01:12:35.360 under control silver
01:12:38.190 [Applause]
01:12:51.840 and portugal are about to make a second
01:12:53.760 change as well ricardo caresma the
01:12:55.920 striker is going to come on there he is
01:13:00.880 and so the first of these changes is
01:13:03.040 bernardo silva
01:13:04.400 making way and ricardo karezma comes on
01:13:07.440 in his place now 34 years of age
01:13:11.710 [Applause]
01:13:17.600 and the change for spain sees
01:13:20.640 andres iniesta the man who won the world
01:13:23.199 cup for spain in 2010 go off to a
01:13:26.239 standing ovation
01:13:34.719 and thiago comes on in his place
01:13:37.450 [Applause]
01:13:47.040 tiago
01:13:48.560 born in italy to
01:13:50.159 brazilian parents but moved to spain as
01:13:52.159 a child because of his father's career
01:13:54.080 as a professional footballer you may
01:13:55.920 remember mazzinho who won the 1994 world
01:13:59.920 cup with brazil the back pass is risky
01:14:03.120 ramos is there ahead of ronaldo
01:14:07.630 [Music]
01:14:10.530 [Applause]
01:14:15.520 costa ahead of him
01:14:19.440 first touch for thiago

01:14:35.120 he knows that was a glorious chance
01:14:43.520 spain and portugal both with players on
01:14:45.600 hat tricks now
01:14:49.360 cristiano ronaldo wins both goals for
01:14:52.320 portugal
01:14:54.719 two from diego costa for spain
01:14:58.000 and the all-important third from nacho
01:15:02.560 we're into the last 20 minutes as you
01:15:04.239 can see
01:15:08.840 ronaldo cedric
01:15:12.880 charesma gets his first involvement and
01:15:15.199 wins a corner
01:15:17.040 comes off albert
01:15:18.090 [Applause]
01:15:21.840 ricardo caresma who played in every
01:15:23.440 match as portugal won the european
01:15:25.040 championship finals two years ago
01:15:29.199 charisma's ball
01:15:31.440 moutinho looking to set it up at the far

01:16:21.840 when
01:16:22.719 the departure of
01:16:24.159 lopetegui was announced but
01:16:28.159 said he couldn't say no
01:16:29.920 when offered it
01:16:31.280 may well of course return to being
01:16:32.800 spain's sporting director after this
01:16:34.560 world cup
01:16:37.260 [Applause]
01:16:42.560 but for the moment he's the man in the
01:16:44.080 spain hot seat
01:16:50.320 ramos
01:16:53.120 terrific ball
01:16:56.159 nacho

01:19:37.330 [Music]
01:19:45.199 drives it towards goal de gea are always
01:19:47.120 confident it was going high
01:19:57.920 ricardo charesma who
01:20:00.000 made his international debut for
01:20:01.199 portugal all the way back in 2003 but
01:20:03.440 this is actually his first world cup
01:20:04.960 finals appearance
01:20:08.639 and another change for spain lucas
01:20:10.560 vasquez
01:20:12.080 the striker is going to come on
01:20:15.390 [Music]
01:20:21.440 and it will be diego costa

01:20:55.679 off this world cup he actually didn't
01:20:57.040 play in the world cup qualifiers

01:21:03.760 appearance
01:21:05.520 26 years of age he'll be 27
01:21:08.400 on the 1st of july

01:21:28.960 guerrero
01:21:33.199 william
01:21:34.880 guerrero
01:21:36.960 trying to find xiao mario
01:21:39.040 who gives away the free kick
01:21:45.040 charmander who wasn't involved in last
01:21:46.560 year's confederations cup here in russia
01:21:49.040 because he was injured at the time
01:21:52.560 and spain understandably
01:21:55.280 now beginning to take all the time they
01:21:57.120 possibly can over restarting play
01:22:00.320 it is that sort of evening particularly
01:22:01.920 when you've been running around like
01:22:03.040 diego costa has
01:22:05.750 [Applause]
01:22:07.040 another change for portugal andre silva
01:22:12.000 nine goals in qualifying for the milan
01:22:15.120 striker
01:22:30.800 ronaldo de gea has come out ronaldo's
01:22:33.440 touch
01:22:34.480 picked up here by charisma and handball
01:22:37.199 from the portuguese substitute
01:22:39.600 [Applause]
01:22:46.000 and will there be further action taken
01:22:47.760 against ricardo karezma by the italian
01:22:49.920 official
01:22:54.400 high ball over the top it was an awkward
01:22:56.400 one as it bounced
01:22:57.840 de gea just stood his ground
01:23:00.719 and then an arm was used by charisma to
01:23:02.800 control
01:23:12.200 [Applause]
01:23:21.679 meanwhile the change will be made and it
01:23:23.520 is gonzalo quaydash who is the player is
01:23:26.719 coming off
01:23:30.000 andre silva on in his place
01:23:35.720 [Music]
01:23:38.639 andrei silva who was the only outfield
01:23:40.639 player to play in all 10 qualifying
01:23:42.639 matches for at portugal
01:23:52.000 pk will be okay to continue in just a
01:23:54.000 moment or so's time
01:23:56.270 [Music]
01:24:00.239 andre silva who averages basically a
01:24:02.239 goal every other game for portugal he's
01:24:04.320 got 12 goals this is 24th
01:24:07.760 international appearance
01:24:28.639 nacho
01:24:34.880 ramos
01:24:36.560 we're into the last 10 minutes then plus
01:24:38.320 whatever additional time is going to be
01:24:40.080 played
01:24:42.159 will be quite a chunk of that you would
01:24:43.440 think with all the substitutions we've
01:24:44.719 had in this second half
01:24:47.840 silver
01:24:51.030 [Music]
01:24:54.450 [Applause]
01:25:03.520 tiago's little ball in field
01:25:05.840 this is alba
01:25:10.000 ramos
01:25:14.080 you get the feeling spain will be quite
01:25:15.520 happy just to keep possession for
01:25:17.679 the remaining time passing it
01:25:19.920 between themselves but we know that's
01:25:21.679 not going to happen
01:25:22.960 for all of the time
01:25:24.960 busquets
01:25:27.140 [Applause]
01:25:28.400 portugal
01:25:29.440 going to have to gamble a little more
01:25:31.120 the introduction of andre silva
01:25:33.360 will certainly give them a fresh pair of
01:25:35.280 legs up front
01:25:36.639 thiago
01:25:40.180 [Applause]
01:25:46.000 interestingly portugal have never lost
01:25:48.080 when ronaldo has scored more than one
01:25:50.719 goal in a fixture
01:25:52.800 that might be about to change
01:25:56.130 [Music]
01:25:57.800 [Applause]
01:25:59.600 ramos
01:26:07.410 [Applause]
01:26:09.520 thiago
01:26:11.600 silva
01:26:13.280 trying to find lucas lucas vasquez
01:26:16.239 didn't really get hold of it
01:26:22.160 [Applause]
01:26:30.940 [Applause]
01:26:36.970 [Applause]
01:26:41.440 late goals have been a feature of this
01:26:43.679 world cup here in russia so
01:26:48.840 far don't think there will be anybody
01:26:51.360 leaving this stadium
01:26:54.239 a little early
01:26:58.159 it's their time for
01:27:00.080 fernando santos team
01:27:03.760 one moment of magic
01:27:05.280 one mistake at the back they've already
01:27:06.800 benefited from one error from david de
01:27:09.120 gea
01:27:11.360 formed by cedric
01:27:16.320 ronaldo lets it run
01:27:18.960 it is a spain throw
01:27:25.760 now ronaldo might be in trouble here
01:27:28.140 [Applause]
01:27:36.000 not sir
01:27:38.910 [Applause]
01:27:44.639 although in his defense it wasn't the
01:27:46.000 best of uh
01:27:47.760 handling from jordi albert
01:27:52.239 lucas vasquez
01:27:54.080 here's nacho
01:27:58.639 pk
01:28:01.180 [Applause]
01:28:09.679 away by rui patricio
01:28:14.239 ronaldo
01:28:16.320 charisma's on this near side if portugal
01:28:18.400 can work it out to him
01:28:22.140 [Applause]
01:28:31.330 [Applause]
01:28:36.880 lucas
01:28:42.620 [Applause]
01:28:48.380 [Applause]
01:28:55.440 here's pk
01:28:56.390 [Applause]
01:29:02.560 underneath it is cedric not the best of
01:29:04.800 headers
01:29:06.080 thiago
01:29:07.840 lucas vasquez
01:29:10.719 here he is with a little ball through
01:29:17.600 another change for spain
01:29:32.159 so with
01:29:33.520 thiago aspas already on lucas vasquez
01:29:36.960 comes on as well
01:29:37.900 [Applause]
01:29:43.600 david silva the man who makes way
01:29:56.490 [Music]
01:29:59.040 that's the third and final change
01:30:08.159 ronaldo goes down gets a free kick
01:30:16.230 [Applause]
01:30:20.170 [Music]
01:30:25.040 challenges by pk
01:30:27.199 now this is a key moment
01:30:31.440 we know who's going to strike it
01:30:44.000 a little over three minutes plus
01:30:45.679 additional time remaining
01:30:48.080 as so often
01:30:50.080 portugal's hopes
01:30:51.600 rest on cristiano ronaldo sheldous
01:31:04.800 referee trying to
01:31:06.560 get the wall back the required distance
01:31:19.520 ronaldo
01:31:20.340 [Applause]
01:31:22.000 oh
01:31:22.960 genius
01:31:24.159 absolute genius
01:31:44.560 would you believe it
01:31:46.800 [Applause]
01:31:51.840 look at de gea's position he's not gonna
01:31:54.320 get that is he
01:31:56.000 up over the wall down under the crossbar
01:31:59.320 [Applause]
01:32:02.000 it's an exquisite free-kick
01:32:05.920 exemplary
01:32:07.840 perfection
01:32:10.560 and it's all square in sochi and it's a
01:32:12.880 hat-trick for cristiano ronaldo
01:32:16.060 [Applause]
01:32:22.160 [Music]
01:32:27.360 spanish hearts being broken
01:32:29.679 right at the end
01:32:32.239 it's his sixth hat trick for portugal
01:32:35.120 his 51st in his career and it's the 51st
01:32:39.840 hat-trick at a world cup finals
01:32:43.710 [Applause]
01:32:46.960 late goals
01:32:48.880 most certainly are a feature of this
01:32:51.440 world cup so far and who knows
01:32:54.400 is there to be further goal action
01:33:07.440 [Applause]
01:33:15.280 a simply extraordinary night in sochi
01:33:17.840 and it's far from finished
01:33:19.760 as we go into the last minute of the
01:33:22.239 regulation 90 plus whatever additional
01:33:24.400 time we're going to have
01:33:31.120 the eyes have it the concentration
01:33:34.870 [Applause]
01:33:39.120 it's absolutely wonderful
01:33:45.030 [Applause]
01:33:47.280 he becomes the first player to score a
01:33:50.159 hat-trick against spain at a world cup
01:33:52.159 finals
01:33:55.440 now remember this was a spanish side who
01:33:57.600 conceded just three goals in the whole
01:34:00.400 of their qualifying campaign mind you
01:34:02.400 portugal only conceded four in their
01:34:04.400 qualifying campaign and we have had six
01:34:07.040 goals here tonight in sochi
01:34:12.320 how much additional time is going to be
01:34:14.560 played the fourth official will show us
01:34:16.480 in just a moment or so time
01:34:18.360 [Applause]
01:34:21.120 portugal have this corner
01:34:23.360 it is a minimum of four minutes
01:34:34.010 [Applause]
01:34:37.520 plenty forward still in red
01:34:39.600 and portugal get another corner won by
01:34:42.239 rafael guerrero
01:34:45.510 [Music]
01:34:55.470 [Applause]
01:34:59.199 a reminder that cristiano ronaldo as i
